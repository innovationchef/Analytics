Abstract
"In this chapter, we discuss de-esclation of treatment for patients with HPV-positive disease. We discuss the rationale for de-escalation (why de-escalate?), patient selection criteria (who to de-esclate?) and what the treatment options for de-esclation are and the studies that are currently being run in those areas (how to de-escalate?). We stress the importance of clinicians NOT changing the management of oropharyngeal cancer patients outside clinical trials, and encourage them to recruit to the ongoing studies. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017."
"Strong evidence has accumulated in the last 15 years showing that infection by certain human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is etiologically involved in a subset of head and neck cancers (HNCs). In this chapter, epidemiologic-related topics on HNCs are reviewed: (i) HPV-attributable fractions and HPV-type distributions by different anatomical HNC sites, using not only HPV DNA but other more specific markers of causality; (ii) an update of the HPV-related HNCs burden worldwide and by regions; and finally, (iii) the determinants for HPV positivity in HNCs, focussing on gender, age, smoking habits, sexual behavior, and other related factors such as tonsillectomy performance. This information is essential in order to understand the burden of the disease and its dynamics and changing patterns, as well as for planning and assessment of the potential impact of HPV-based preventive strategies for HNCs. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017."
"Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The large majority are squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) that develop in the mucosal linings of the upper aerodigestive tract. These tumors develop either by exogenous carcinogen exposure (smoking, alcohol drinking) or by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly those in the oropharynx (OPSCC). HPV-positive (HPV+ve) and HPV-negative (HPV-ve) OPSCC are considered different disease entities. HPV+ve tumors are different at the molecular level and likely as a consequence have a much more favorable prognosis than HPV-ve tumors, despite their generally advanced stage at presentation. In general, HNSCCs develop in precancerous mucosal changes, and the apparent lack of precancerous HPV+ve mucosal changes is therefore remarkable. In this Chapter, head and neck carcinogenesis is discussed and the molecular differences between HPV+ve and HPV-ve tumors are outlined. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017."
"HNSCC is a heterogeneous group of tumors located in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx. Originally, tobacco and alcohol exposures were the main risk factors for HNSCC. In the last two decades, HPV infections have been identified as a risk factor for HNSCC, especially for oropharyngeal tumors. Whereas the HPV-induced oropharyngeal carcinomas predominantly express the HPV16 related E6 and E7 oncoproteins, the HPV-negative HNSCC are associated with an overexpression of p53. However, if the therapy successes for HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCCs are compared, there are significantly higher total survival rates for HPV-positive oropharyngeal tumors compared to HPV-negative tumors. It is important to understand this phenomenon in order to improve and adapt therapy concepts. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017."
"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a necessary cause of anogenital squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and a subgroup of head and neck SCC, i.e., those originating in the oropharynx. The key events in high-risk HPV (HRHPV)-associated neoplastic progression include persistent infection, deregulated expression of virus early genes in basal epithelial cells, local immune suppression and the accumulation of chromosomal alterations. Evidence for these events particularly comes from studies of uterine cervical carcinogenesis; primary premalignant HRHPV-positive lesions of the head and neck mucosa are seldomly detected. Integration of virus DNA into host chromosomes is considered an important driver of carcinogenesis and observed in 40 up to 90 % of uterine cervical SCC (UCSCC) and oropharyngeal SCC (OPSCC), dependent on the integration detection method used and HRHPV type. In OPSCC, > 90 % HPV-positive tumors are infected with HPV16. Ten up to 60 % of HPV-positive tumors thus contain extrachromosomal (episomal) virus. In this chapter, causes and consequences of HPV integration are summarized from the literature, with special focus on the site of HPV integration in the cellular genome, and its effect on expression of viral oncogenes (particularly E6 and E7), on human (tumor) gene expression and on deregulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell signaling pathways. Also data on DNA methylation, viral load and clinical outcome in relation to HPV integration are provided. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017."
"HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), more specifically the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer, is dramatically increasing in industrialized countries. According to what has been learned from anogenital vaccination programs, there are reasons to believe that current human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations may be potentially effective also against HNSCC. However, before specific results on HNSCC are available, one must keep in mind that carcinogenesis in the head and neck region may differ from that of the anogenital tract. Furthermore, the current evidence supports the view that HPV infection is much more complex than simply a sexually transmitted disease. HPV is present in the semen, placenta and in the newborns, and these infections of the newborns create cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against HPV, including the T memory cells. Acquisition of HPV infection in early life will rise new series of questions in the field of HPV vaccination. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017."
"Cerebrovascular lesions and hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury are important causes of acquired neonatal brain injury in term and preterm newborn infants, which lead to significant morbidity and long-term mortality. Improved understanding of the cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism in the immature brain, and blood flow responses to physiological and external stimuli would aid understanding of the pathogenesis of neonatal brain injury. There has been increasing research interest and clinical demand to study the neonatal brain, with the exploration of the bedside and real-time measurement of cerebral hemodynamics in guiding therapy and predicting outcome. The major techniques which allow the assessment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) with relative ease at the bedside in the neonatal intensive care unit include near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Diffuse optical correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a new technique for which portable devices are currently being developed to continuously monitor relative changes in microvascular CBF at the bedside. DCS can potentially be combined with NIRS to provide continuous simultaneous measurement of changes in CBF and oxygenation, and enables the quantification of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Functional studies have also been utilized with NIRS and magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the connections between localized cortical activity and cerebral hemodynamic responses during early human development. To utilize and translate cerebral hemodynamic measurements in clinical management, future research should aim to establish clinically relevant parameters and references range for cerebral perfusion and oxygenation for the neonatal population. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"In last several years, the focus on the origin and progression of human cancers has shifted from genetic to epigenetic regulation, with particular attention to methylation and acetylation events that have profound effect on the eventual expression of oncogenes and the suppression of tumor suppressors. A few drugs targeting these epigenetic changes have already been approved for treatment, albeit not for lung cancer. With the recent advances in the push towards personalized therapy, questions have been asked about the possible targeting of epigenetic events for personalized lung cancer therapy. Some progress has been made but a lot needs to be done. In this chapter, a succinct review of these topics is provided. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with distinct clinical, pathological and molecular characteristics. Despite robust responses to initial chemotherapy and radiation, the prognosis of patients with SCLC remains poor with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 10 %. Despite the fact that numerous molecularly targeted approaches have thus far failed to demonstrate clinical utility in SCLC, further advances will rely on better defi nition of the biological pathways that drive survival, proliferation and metastasis. Recent next-generation, molecular profi ling studies have identifi ed many new therapeutic targets in SCLC, as well as extreme genomic instability which explains the high degree of resistance. A wide variety of anti-angiogenic agents, growth factor inhibitors, pro-apoptotic agents, and epigenetic modulators have been evaluated in SCLC and many studies of these strategies are on-going. Perhaps the most promising approaches involve agents targeting cancer stem cell pathways and immunomodulatory drugs that interfere with the PD1 and CTLA-4 pathways. SCLC offers many barriers to the development of successful therapy, including limited tumor samples, inadequate preclinical models, high mutational burden, and aggressive tumor growth which impairs functional status and hampers enrollment on clinical trials. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a milieu that enables tumor cells to acquire the hallmarks of cancer. The TME is heterogeneous in composition and consists of cellular components, growth factors, proteases, and extracellular matrix. Concerted interactions between genetically altered tumor cells and genetically stable intratumoral stromal cells result in an ÔÇ£activated/reprogramedÔÇØ stroma that promotes carcinogenesis by contributing to infl ammation, immune suppression, therapeutic resistance, and generating premetastatic niches that support the initiation and establishment of distant metastasis. The lungs present a unique milieu in which tumors progress in collusion with the TME, as evidenced by regions of aberrant angiogenesis, acidosis and hypoxia. Infl ammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, and pulmonary disorders in lung cancer patients such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, constitute comorbid conditions and are independent risk factors for lung cancer. The TME also contributes to immune suppression, induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and diminishes effi cacy of chemotherapies. Thus, the TME has begun to emerge as the ÔÇ£Achilles heelÔÇØ of the disease, and constitutes an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. Drugs targeting the components of the TME are making their way into clinical trials. Here, we will focus on recent advances and emerging concepts regarding the intriguing role of the TME in lung cancer progression, and discuss future directions in the context of novel diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the primary cause of cancer-related death in both men and women in the United States and rest of the world. Due to diagnosis at an advanced stage, it is associated with a high mortality in a majority of patients. In recent years, enormous advances have occurred in the development and application of nanotechnology in the detection, diagnosis, and therapy of cancer. This progress has led to the development of the emerging fi eld of ÔÇ£cancer nanomedicine.ÔÇØ Nanoparticle-based therapeutic systems have gained immense popularity due to their bioavailability, in vivo stability, intestinal absorption, solubility, sustained and targeted delivery, and therapeutic effectiveness of several anticancer agents. Currently, a plethora of nanocarrier formulations are utilized including lipid-based, polymeric and branched polymeric, metal-based, magnetic, and mesoporous silica. In lung cancer, nanoparticle-based therapeutics is paving the way in the diagnosis, imaging, screening, and treatment of primary and metastatic tumors. The application and expansion of novel nanocarriers for drug delivery is an exciting and challenging research fi led, in particular for the delivery of emerging cancer therapies. Some of the current progress and challenges in nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for lung cancer treatment are discussed. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer related deaths in both men and women in the United States and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for over 85 % of all lung cancers. Survival of these patients has not signifi - cantly altered in over 30 years. This chapter initially discusses the clinical presentation of lung cancer patients. Most patients diagnosed with lung cancer due to symptoms have advanced stage cancer. Once diagnosed, lung cancer patients need imaging studies to assess the stage of the disease before decisions regarding therapy are fi nalized. The most important prognostic factors are stage of the disease and performance status and these factors also determine therapy. The chapter subsequently discusses management of each stage of the disease and the impact of several pathologic, clinical factors in personalizing therapy for each individual patient. Transition from chemotherapy for every patient to a more personalized approach based on histology and molecular markers has occurred in the management of advanced stage NSCLC. It is expected that such a personalized approach will extend to all stages of NSCLC and will likely improve the outcomes of all NSCLC patients. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with a 5-year overall survival rate of less than 20 %. Considering the treatments currently available, this statistics is shocking. A possible explanation for the disconnect between sophisticated treatments and the survival rate can be related to the post-treatment enrichment of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs), which is one of a sub-set of drug resistant tumor cells with abilities of self-renewal, cancer initiation, and further maintenance of tumors. Lung CSCs have been associated with resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic treatments. CSCs have also been implicated in tumor recurrence because CSCs are not typically killed after conventional therapy. Investigation of CSCs in determining their role in tumor recurrence and drugresistance relied heavily on the use of specifi c markers present in CSCs, including CD133, ALDH, ABCG2, and Nanog. Yet another cell type that is also associated with increased resistance to treatment is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypic cells. Through the processes of EMT, epithelial cells lose their epithelial phenotype and gain mesenchymal properties, rendering EMT phenotypic cells acquire drug-resistance. In this chapter, we will further discuss the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) especially because miRNA-based therapies are becoming attractive target with respect to therapeutic resistance and CSCs. Finally, the potential role of the natural agents and synthetic derivatives of natural compounds with anti-cancer activity, e.g. curcumin, CDF, and BR-DIM is highlighted in overcoming therapeutic resistance, suggesting that the above mentioned agents could be important for better treatment of lung cancer in combination therapy. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"This chapter reviews and discusses approaches and strategies of personalized radiation therapy (PRT) for lung cancers at four different levels: (1) clinically established PRT based on a patientÔÇÖs histology, stage, tumor volume and tumor locations; (2) personalized adaptive radiation therapy (RT) based on image response during treatment; (3) PRT based on biomarkers; (4) personalized fractionation schedule. The current RT practice for lung cancer is partially individualized according to tumor histology, stage, size/location, and combination with use of systemic therapy. During-RT PET-CT image guided adaptive treatment is being tested in a multicenter trial. Treatment response detected by the during-RT images may also provide a strategy to further personalize the remaining treatment. Research on biomarker-guided PRT is ongoing. The biomarkers include genomics, proteomics, microRNA, cytokines, metabolomics from tumor and blood samples, and radiomics from PET, CT, SPECT images. Finally, RT fractionation schedule may also be personalized to each individual patient to maximize therapeutic gain. Future PRT should be based on comprehensive considerations of knowledge acquired from all these levels, as well as consideration of the societal value such as cost and effectiveness. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"The progression of a cancer cell into a metastatic entity contributes to more than 90 % of cancer related deaths. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of metastasis is an unmet clinical need. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an evolutionary conserved developmental program, which is induced during cancer progression and contributes to metastatic colonization. EMT endows metastatic properties upon cancer cells by enhancing mobility, invasion, and resistance to apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, EMT-derived tumor cells acquire stem cell properties and exhibit therapeutic resistance. The disseminated tumor cells recruited to distant organs are suggested to subsequently undergo an EMT reversion through mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), necessary for effi cient colonization and macrometastasis. A major focus of cancer research is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying EMT/MET in tumor invasion, dissemination and metastasis. In this chapter, we will focus on the contribution of the EMT signaling pathways in lung cancer progression, cancer stem cells and acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chemotherapy. We will also discuss the potential of targeting EMT pathways as an attractive strategy for the treatment of lung cancer. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Bone, which includes several cell populations and numerous cytokines and chemokines that provide cell-cell signaling, is a common destination for many cancer metastases. Bone metastasis skews this signaling to develop vicious cycles between immune, bone and cancer populations that lead to abnormal bone remodeling during cancer niche construction. Temporal models utilize positive feedback systems as an integrative tool providing insights into the rate-limiting processes that determine multiple stages of the bone metastasis. We develop a logical-transient-threshold framework by linking temporal responses of the cancer, bone and immune systems through macrophages during ecological niche construction of cancer in host bone. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"The two clinically validated and Food and Drug Administration approved lung cancer predictive biomarkers (epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations) occur in only about 20 % of lung adenocarcinomas and acquired resistance develops to fi rst generation drugs. Several other oncogenic drivers for lung adenocarcinoma have emerged as potentially druggable targets with new predictive biomarkers. Oncologists are requesting testing for ROS 1 translocations which predict susceptibility to crizotinib, already approved for ALK positive lung cancers. Other potential biomarkers which are currently undergoing clinical trials are RET, MET, HER2 and BRAF. Detection of these biomarkers includes fl uorescent in situ hybridization and/or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (ROS1, RET, HER2), mutation analysis (BRAF) and immunohistochemistry (MET). Screening by immunohistochemistry may be useful for some biomarkers (ROS1, BRAF). Targeted next generation sequencing techniques may be useful as well. These fi ve biomarkers are under consideration for inclusion in revised lung cancer biomarker guidelines by the College of American Pathologists, International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and Association for Molecular Pathology. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and the 5-year overall survival outlook for a patient has not improved in several decades. Recently, however, molecular and genomic profi ling of the lung tumors has revealed recurring somatic mutations. As a result the therapeutic landscape of lung cancer is undergoing a paradigm shift from a purely histology-based understanding of the disease to subtype distinctions based on tumor genetics, which has launched cancer-specifi c, mechanism-based targeted therapies with clear benefi t to patients. While targeted therapy advancements are being made at an ever increasing rate, a new challenge in the form of drug resistance has also emerged. This review summarizes the current literature for these issues. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"In the field of pathology it is clear that molecular genomics and digital imaging represent two promising future directions, and both are as relevant to the tumor microenvironment as they are to the tumor itself (Beck AH et al. Sci Transl Med 3(108):108ra113-08ra113, 2011). Digital imaging, or whole slide imaging (WSI), of glass histology slides facilitates a number of value-added competencies which were not previously possible with the traditional analog review of these slides under a microscope by a pathologist. As an important tool for investigational research, digital pathology can leverage the quantification and reproducibility offered by image analysis to add value to the pathology field. This chapter will focus on the application of image analysis to investigate the tumor microenvironment and how quantitative investigation can provide deeper insight into our understanding of the tumor to tumor microenvironment relationship. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"A tumor vasculature that is functionally abnormal results in irregular gradients of metabolites and drugs within the tumor tissue. Recently, significant efforts have been committed to experimentally examine how cellular response to anti-cancer treatments varies based on the environment in which the cells are grown. In vitro studies point to specific conditions in which tumor cells can remain dormant and survive the treatment. In vivo results suggest that cells can escape the effects of drug therapy in tissue regions that are poorly penetrated by the drugs. Better understanding how the tumor microenvironments influence the emergence of drug resistance in both primary and metastatic tumors may improve drug development and the design of more effective therapeutic protocols. This chapter presents a hybrid agent-based model of the growth of tumor micrometastases and explores how microenvironmental factors can contribute to the development of acquired resistance in response to a DNA damaging drug. The specific microenvironments of interest in this work are tumor hypoxic niches and tumor normoxic sanctuaries with poor drug penetration. We aim to quantify how spatial constraints of limited drug transport and quiescent cell survival contribute to the development of drug resistant tumors. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Although extensive research effort and resources have been dedicated to the development of nanotherapeutics to treat cancer, few formulations have reached clinical application. A major reason is that the large number of parameters available to tune nanotherapy characteristics coupled with the variability in tumor tissue precludes evaluation of complex interactions through experimentation alone. In order to optimize the nanotechnology design and gain further insight into these phenomena, mathematical modeling and computational simulation have been applied to complement empirical work. In this chapter, we discuss modeling work related to nanotherapy and the tumor microenvironment. We first summarize the biology underlying the dysregulated tumor microenvironment, followed by a description of major nano-scale parameters. We then present an overview of the mathematical modeling of cancer nanotherapy, including evaluation of nanotherapy in multi-dimensional tumor tissue, coupling of nanotherapy with vascular flow, modeling of nanotherapy in combination with in vivo imaging, modeling of nanoparticle transport based on in vitro data, modeling of vasculature-bound nanoparticles, evaluation of nanotherapy using pharmacokinetic modeling, and modeling of nanobased hyperthermia. We conclude that an even tighter interdisciplinary effort between biological, material, and physical scientists is needed in order to eventually overcome the tumor microenvironment barrier to successful nanotherapy. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is mediated by two major mechanisms namely secondary mutation T790M in EGFR and cMET amplification. Other molecular mediators which contribute towards TKI resistance include the activation of compensatory growth signaling, epithelial mesenchymal transition and microRNAs regulating EGFR and cMET levels. In this chapter, we have included the major mechanisms which contribute towards EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC. Several therapeutic approaches to overcome TKI resistance are also presented which include second and third generation EGFR TKI inhibitors and cMET inhibitors. Further, the rationale to utilize the combination therapies to simultaneously target EGFR and other major oncogene addictive pathway such as ERBB2 and AXL kinase is outlined. Another promising approach to overcome TKI resistance is to potentiate EGFR protein for degradation. These studies will best be utilized when we can identify the oncogene addictions in an individual patient and tailor the therapy/therapies accordingly for the maximum benefits. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Cancer is a genetic disease characterized by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Over time, somatic mutations accumulate in the cells of an individual due to replication errors, chromosome segregation errors, or DNA damage. When not caught by traditional mechanisms, these somatic mutations can lead to cellular proliferation, the hallmark of cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, accounting for approximately 160,000 deaths annually. Five year survival rates for lung cancer remain low (<50 %) for all stages, with even worse prognosis (<15 %) in late stage cases. Technological advances, including advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS), offer the vision of personalized medicine or precision oncology, wherein an individualÔÇÖs treatment can be based on his or her individual molecular profi le, rather than on historical population-based medicine. Towards this end, NGS has already been used to identify new biomarker candidates for the early diagnosis of lung cancer and is increasingly used to guide personalized treatment decisions. In this review we will provide a high-level overview of NGS technology and summarize its application to the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. We will also describe how NGS can drive advances that bring us closer to precision oncology and discuss some of the technical challenges that will need to be overcome in order to realize this ultimate goal. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"This chapter explores the use of mathematical models as promising and powerful tools to understand the complexity of tumors and their, frequently, hypoxic environment.We focus on gliomas, which are primary brain tumors derived from glial cells, mainly astrocytes and/or oligodendrocytes. A variety of mathematical models, based on ordinary and/or partial differential equations, have been developed both at the micro and macroscopic levels. The aim here is to describe in a quantitative way key physiopathological mechanisms relevant in these types of malignancies and to suggest optimal therapeutical strategies. More specifically, we consider novel therapies targeting thromboembolic phenomena to decrease cell invasion in high grade glioma or to delay the malignant transformation in low grade gliomas. This study has been the basis of a multidisciplinary collaboration involving, among others, neuro-oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, cancer biologists, surgeons and mathematicians. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Solid tumor dissemination from the primary site to the sites of metastasis involves tumor cell transport through the blood or lymph circulation systems. Once the tumor cells enter the bloodstream, they encounter a new hostile microenvironment. The cells must withstand hemodynamic forces and overcome the effects of fluid shear. The cells are exposed to immunological signaling insults from leukocytes, to collisions with erythrocytes, and to interactions with platelets or macrophages. Finally, the cells need to attach to the blood vessel walls and extravasate to the surrounding stroma to form tumor metastases. Although only a small fraction of invasive cells is able to complete the metastatic process, most cancer-related deaths are the result of tumor metastasis. Thus, investigating the intracellular properties of circulating tumor cells and the extracellular conditions that allow the tumor cells to survive and thrive in this microenvironment is of vital interest. In this chapter, we discuss the intravascular microenvironment that the circulating tumor cells must endure. We summarize the current experimental and computational literature on tumor cells in the circulation system. We also illustrate various aspects of the intravascular transport of circulating tumor cells using a mathematical model based on immersed boundary principles. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"We review results about the structure of administration of chemotherapeutic anti-cancer treatment that we have obtained from an analysis of minimally parameterized mathematical models using methods of optimal control. This is a branch of continuous-time optimization that studies the minimization of a performance criterion imposed on an underlying dynamical system subject to constraints. The scheduling of anti-cancer treatments has all the features of such a problem: treatments are administered in time and the interactions of the drugs with the tumor and its microenvironment determine the efficacy of therapy. At the same time, constraints on the toxicity of the treatments need to be taken into account. The models we consider are low-dimensional and do not include more refined details, but they capture the essence of the underlying biology and our results give robust and rather conclusive qualitative information about the administration of optimal treatment protocols that strongly correlate with approaches taken in medical practice. We describe the changes that arise in optimal administration schedules as the mathematical models are increasingly refined to progress from models that only consider the cancerous cells to models that include the major components of the tumor microenvironment, namely the tumor vasculature and tumorimmune system interactions. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Tumors cannot be understood in isolation from their microenvironment. Tumor and stromal cells change phenotype based upon biochemical and biophysical inputs from their surroundings, even as they interact with and remodel the microenvironment. Cancer should be investigated as an adaptive, multicellular system in a dynamical microenvironment. Computational modeling offers the potential to detangle this complex system, but the modeling platform must ideally account for tumor heterogeneity, substrate and signaling factor biotransport, cell and tissue biophysics, tissue and vascular remodeling, microvascular and interstitial flow, and links between all these sub-systems. Such a platform should leverage high-throughput experimental data, while using open data standards for reproducibility. In this chapter, we review advances by our groups in these key areas, particularly in advanced models of tissue mechanics and interstitial flow, open source simulation software, high-throughput phenotypic screening, and multicellular data standards. In the future, we expect a transformation of computational cancer biology from individual groups modeling isolated parts of cancer, to coalitions of groups combining compatible tools to simulate the 3-D multicellular systems biology of cancer tissues. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"The tumor-associated microvasculature is one of the key elements of the microenvironment that helps shape, and is shaped by, tumor progression.Given the important role of the vasculature in tumor progression, and the fact that tumor and normal vasculature are physiologically and molecularly distinct, much effort has gone into the development of vascular-targeting drugs that in theory should target tumors without significant risk to normal tissue. In this chapter, a multiscale hybrid mathematical model of tumor-vascular interactions is presented to provide a theoretical basis for assessing tumor response to vascular-targeting drugs. Model performance is calibrated to quantitative clinical data on tumor response to angiogenesis inhibitors (AIs), preclinical data on response to a cytotoxic chemotherapy, and qualitative preclinical data on response to vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). The calibrated model is then used to explore two questions of clinical interest. First, the hypothesis that AIs and VDAs are complementary treatments, rather than redundant, is explored. The model predicts a minimal increase in antitumor activity as a result of adding a VDA to an AI treatment regimen, and in fact at times the combination can exert less antitumor activity than stand-alone AI treatment. Second, the question of identifying an optimal dosing strategy for treating with an AI and a cytotoxic agent is addressed. Using a stochastic optimization scheme, an intermittent schedule for both chemotherapy and AI administration is identified that can eradicate the simulated tumors. We propose that this schedule may have increased clinical antitumor activity compared to currently used treatment protocols. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"With the exception of a limited number of sites in the body, primary tumors infrequently lead to the demise of cancer patients. Instead, mortality and a significant degree of morbidity result from the growth of secondary tumors in distant organs. Tumor survival, growth and dissemination are associated with the formation of both new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and new lymph vessels (lymphagenesis or lymphangiogenesis). Although intensive research in tumor angiogenesis has been going on for the past four decades, experimental results in tumor lymphangiogenesis began to appear only in the last 10 years. In this chapter we expand the models proposed by Friedman, Lolas and Pepper on tumor lymphangiogenesis mediated by proteolytically and un-proteolytically processed growth factors (Friedman and Lolas G, Math Models Methods Appl Sci 15(01):95-107, 2005; Pepper and Lolas G, Selected topics in cancer modeling: genesis, evolution, immune competition, and therapy. In: The lymphatic vascular system in lymphangiogenesis invasion and metastasis a mathematical approach. Birkh├ñuser Boston, Boston, pp 1-22, 2008). The variables represent different cell densities and growth factors concentrations, and where possible the parameters are estimated from experimental and clinical data. The results obtained from computational simulations carried out on the model equations produce dynamic heterogeneous (ÔÇ£anarchicÔÇØ) spatiotemporal solutions. More specifically, we observed coherent masses of tumor clusters migrating around and within the lymphatic network. Our findings are in line with recent experimental evidence that associate cluster formation with the minimization of cell loss favoring high local extracellular matrix proteolysis and thus protecting cancer invading cells from an immunological assault driven by the lymphatic network. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Tumor vasculature, the blood vessel network supplying a growing tumor with nutrients such as oxygen or glucose, is in many respects different from the hierarchically organized arterio-venous blood vessel network in normal tissues. Angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), vessel cooption (the integration of existing blood vessels into the tumor vasculature), and vessel regression remodel the healthy vascular network into a tumor-specific vasculature. Integrative models, based on detailed experimental data and physical laws, implement, in silico, the complex interplay of molecular pathways, cell proliferation, migration, and death, tissue microenvironment, mechanical and hydrodynamic forces, and the fine structure of the host tissue vasculature. With the help of computer simulations high-precision information about blood flow patterns, interstitial fluid flow, drug distribution, oxygen and nutrient distribution can be obtained and a plethora of therapeutic protocols can be tested before clinical trials. This chapter provides an overview over the current status of computer simulations of vascular remodeling during tumor growth including interstitial fluid flow, drug delivery, and oxygen supply within the tumor. The model predictions are compared with experimental and clinical data and a number of longstanding physiological paradigms about tumor vasculature and intratumoral solute transport are critically scrutinized. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"The cancer cells obtain their invasion potential not only by genetic mutations, but also by changing their cellular biophysical and biomechanical features and adapting to the surrounding microenvironments. The extracellular matrix, as a crucial component of the tumor microenvironment, provides the mechanical support for the tissue, mediates the cell-microenvironment interactions, and plays a key role in cancer cell invasion. The biomechanics of the extracellular matrix, particularly collagen, have been extensively studied in the biomechanics community. Cell migration has also enjoyed much attention from both the experimental and modeling efforts. However, the detailed mechanistic understanding of tumor cell-ECM interactions, especially during cancer invasion, has been unclear. This chapter reviews the recent advances in the studies of ECM biomechanics, cell migration, and cell-ECM interactions in the context of cancer invasion. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

"Phagocytosis and elimination of shed aged photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelial cells is crucial for photoreceptor function and survival. Genetic studies on a natural animal model of recessive retinal degeneration allowed the identification of MerTK, the gene encoding the surface receptor required for POS internalization. Following this discovery, screenings of DNA samples from patients have revealed that MERTK mutations cause retinal degenerations in humans. MERTK patients present some of the classical symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa, but it is atypical in that the disease develops very early during childhood and the macula is also involved early on. Therefore, the phenotype ought to be qualified as a rod-cone dystrophy. Recently, MERTK has been implicated in various types of cancers and sclerosis.

"The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a pivotal cellular regulator involved in the folding, activation and assembly of a wide range of proteins. Hsp90 has multiple roles in the retina and the use of different Hsp90 inhibitors has been shown to prevent retinal degeneration in models of retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Hsp90 is also a potential target in uveal melanoma. Mechanistically, Hsp90 inhibition can evoke a dual response in the retina; stimulating a stress response with molecular chaperone expression. Thereby leading to an improvement in visual function and photoreceptor survival; however, prolonged inhibition can also stimulate the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins potentially deleteriously affect vision. Here, we review the multiple roles of Hsp90 in the retina and the therapeutic potential of Hsp90 as a target. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Epigenetic regulation refers to heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve any alteration of the DNA sequence. DNA methylation, histone modifi cation, and gene regulation by microRNAs are well-known epigenetic modulations that are closely associated with several cellular processes and diverse disease states, such as cancers, even under precancerous conditions. More recently, several studies have indicated that epigenetic changes may be associated with renal cystic diseases, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and the restoration of altered epigenetic factors may become a therapeutic target of renal cystic disease and would be expected to have minimal side effects. This review focuses on recently reported fi ndings on epigenetic and considers the potential of targeting epigenetic regulation as a novel therapeutic approach to control cystogenesis. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016."
"We discuss how an imperfect visual cycle results in the formation of vitamin A dimers, thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of various retinal diseases, and summarize how slowing vitamin A dimerization has been a therapeutic target of interest to prevent blindness. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of vitamin A dimerization, an alternative form of vitamin A, one that forms dimers more slowly yet maneuvers effortlessly through the visual cycle, was developed. Such a vitamin A, reinforced with deuterium (C20-D3-vitamin A), can be used as a non-disruptive tool to understand the contribution of vitamin A dimers to vision loss. Eventually, C20-D3-vitamin A could become a disease-modifying therapy to slow or stop vision loss associated with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Stargardt disease and retinal diseases marked by such vitamin A dimers. Human clinical trials of C20-D3-vitamin A (ALK-001) are underway. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Recent data have revealed epigenetic derangements and subsequent chromatin remodeling as a potent biologic switch for chronic inflammation and cell survival which are important therapeutic targets in the pathogenesis of several retinal degenerations. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a major component of this system and serve as a unique control of the chromatin remodeling process. With a multitude of targeted HDAC inhibitors now available, their use in both basic science and clinical studies has widened substantially. In the field of ocular biology, there are data to suggest that HDAC inhibition may suppress neovascularization and may be a possible treatment for retinitis pigmentosa and dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, the effects of these inhibitors on cell survival and chemokine expression in the chorioretinal tissues remain very unclear. Here, we review the multifaceted biology of HDAC activity and pharmacologic inhibition while offering further insight into the importance of this epigenetic pathway in retinal degenerations. Our laboratory investigations aim to open translational avenues to advance dry AMD therapeutics while exploring the role of acetylation on inflammatory gene expression in the aging and degenerating retina. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the primary cause of vision loss in the western world (Friedman et al., Arch Ophthalmol 122:564ÔÇô572, 2004). The first clinical indication of AMD is the presence of drusen. However, with age and prior to the formation of drusen, extracellular basal deposits accumulate between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and BruchÔÇÖs membrane (BrM). Many studies on the molecular composition of the basal deposits and drusen have demonstrated the presence of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, complement components and cellular debris. The evidence reviewed here suggests that alteration in RPE cell function might be the primary cause for the accumulation of ECM and cellular debri found in basal deposits. Further studies are obviously needed in order to unravel the specific pathways that lead to abnormal formation of ECM and complement activation. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a prototypical cytokine with functional pleiotropy and plays an important role in host defense. When infections or tissue injuries occur, IL-6 is promptly produced by monocytes and macrophages and contributes to removal of infectious agents and restoration of damaged tissues through activation of immune, hematological, and acute-phase responses. Once stress is removed from the host, IL-6 synthesis ends, but uncontrolled excessive or persistent IL-6 production plays a pathological role in the development of various inflammatory diseases and cancers, indicating that IL-6 is a double-edged sword for the host. Thus, the proper IL-6 expression is very important for host defense and is strictly controlled by chromatin structure, transcriptional regulation, and posttranscriptional modification. Differentiation status of cells, various transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and microRNAs are involved in this process. Since it is assumed that dysregulation of any of these regulatory molecules may cause abnormal IL-6 expression in a particular disease, further elucidation of the factors and processes involved in IL-6 expression can be expected to facilitate to clarification of pathogenesis and to identification of novel target molecule(s) for specific diseases. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016."

"Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is the latest addition to the IL-12 family of het-erodimeric cytokines, consisting of IL-12 p35 subunit and IL-27P subunit Epstein-Barr virus induced 3 (EBI3). Since its discovery, IL-35 has been shown to exhibit immunosuppressive activities which are distinct from other members of IL-12 family. IL-35 is also unique in that it is expressed primarily by regulatory T-cells (Tregs) rather than by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). IL-35 can directly suppress effector T-cell proliferation and function and inhibit the differentiation of Th17 cells. It is also able to expand regulatory responses to promote tolerance to infections by generating a potent population of IL-35-producing inducible Tregs (iTr35). As the new cellular sources of IL-35 such as CD8+Tregs, Bregs, and tolerogenic dendritic cells DCs (tolDCs) are identified, more immunoregulatory functions of this cytokine are explored. IL-35 has been shown to be associated with a range of autoimmune diseases and cancer models. It appears to be a promising diagnostic biomarker. A greater understanding of the expression and regulatory mechanisms of IL-35 will be beneficial to the development of novel immune therapies. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016."
"Transient expression of exogenous proteins facilitates studies of molecular mechanisms and utility for transplantation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in culture. Here, we compared expression of the membrane protein ╬▓5 integrin- GFP (╬▓5-GFP) in two recently established models of differentiated human RPE, adult RPE stem cell-derived RPE and primary fetal RPE, upon infection with recombinant adenovirus or transfection with DNA in liposomes. We varied viral titer and duration of virus incubation and examined ╬▓5-GFP and the tight junction marker ZO-1 in manipulated cells by confocal microscopy. Fewer than 5 % of cells expressed ╬▓5-GFP after liposome-mediated transfection. The percentage of cells with detectable ╬▓5-GFP exceeded 90 % after adenovirus infection for as little as 1 h. Decreasing virus titer two-fold did not alter the fraction of cells expressing ╬▓5-GFP but increased variability of ╬▓5-GFP level among cells. In cells with low expression levels, ╬▓5-GFP localized mostly to the apical plasma membrane like endogenous ╬▒v╬▓5 integrin. In cells with high expression levels, ╬▓5-GFP localized to the cytoplasm in addition to the apical surface suggesting accumulation in trafficking compartments. Altogether, adenovirus delivery yields efficient exogenous membrane protein expression of correct polarity in differentiated human RPE cells in culture. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Embryonic lethality in mice with targeted gene deletion is a major issue that can be circumvented by using Cre-loxP-based animal models. Various inducible Cre systems are available, e.g. such that are activated following tamoxifen treatment, and allow deletion of a specific target gene at any desired time point during the life span of the animal. In this study, we describe the efficiency of topical tamoxifen administration by eye drops using a Cre- reporter mouse strain (R26R). We report that tamoxifen-responsive CAGGCre-ERÔäó mice show a robust Cremediated recombination throughout the entire eye. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Interleukin (IL)-23 plays a central role in the orchestration of inflammatory responses. Produced by dendritic cells and macrophages, this cytokine promotes the protection of the host against mucosal pathogens through the induction of IL-17 and related cytokines by lymphoid cells. Preclinical disease models and association studies in humans have also clearly demonstrated the implication of IL-23 signalling pathway in inflammatory diseases. Indeed, this cytokine is now considered as a major therapeutic target in immune-based pathologies such as psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn's disease. Furthermore, in the context of inflammation-related cancer, IL-23 is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis and progression to metastatic disease. Herein, we review our current understanding of IL-23 regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. We discuss the relevance of these findings in the context of infection, chronic inflammation and cancer. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016."
"IL-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has diverse immune regulatory activities under both physiological and pathological conditions. IL-27 enhances the functions of Th1 and CD8+ T cells, promotes the development of Tfh and Tr1, and suppresses the functions of Th2, Treg, Th9, and Th17 cells. IL-27 is also involved in regulation of immune responses of B cells, NK, DCs, and macrophages. IL-27 production is strictly regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Given its broad effects on immune regulation, IL-27 has been implicated in the pathogeneses of autoimmune and infectious diseases as well as cancers. In this chapter, the biological characters of IL-27 have been reviewed, including the molecular mechanisms of IL-27 production and the underlying cellular signaling pathway. The regulatory effects of IL-27 on immune responses in autoimmune disease, infectious disease, and cancer are also discussed. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016."
"The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that is considered to be a cellular antennae, because proteins related to multiple signaling pathways such as Wnt, PDGFR╬▒, Hh, and mechanosignaling are localized to the membrane of the primary cilium. In the kidney, primary cilia extend from the cell membrane to the lumen of renal tubules to respond to fl uidic stress. Recent studies have indicated that the disruption of ciliary proteins including polycystin-1 (PC1), polycystin-2 (PC2), and members of the intrafl agellar transport (IFT) family induce the development of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), suggesting that the malformation or absence of primary cilia is a driving force of the onset of PKD. Therefore, in this chapter, the renal cystogenesis mechanism induced by cilia defects and pathogenic ciliary proteins associated with PKD development will be described. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016."
"Serine/threonine kinase Akt is a downstream effector of insulin receptor/ PI3K pathway that is involved in many processes, including providing neuroprotection to stressed rod photoreceptor cells. Akt signaling is known to be regulated by the serine/threonine phosphatases, PHLPP (PH domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase) and PHLPPL (PH domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase-like). We previously reported that both phosphatases are expressed in the retina, as well as in photoreceptor cells. In this study, we examined the PHLPP and PHLPPL phosphatase activities towards non-physiological and physiological substrates. Our results suggest that PHLPP was more active than PHLPPL towards non-physiological substrates, whereas both PHLPP and PHLPP dephosphorylated the physiological substrates of Akt1 and Akt3 with similar efficiencies. Our results also suggest that knockdown of PHLPPL alone does not increase Akt phosphorylation, due to a compensatory increase of PHLPP, which results in the dephosphorylation of Akt. Therefore, PHLPP and PHLPPL regulate Akt activation together when both phosphatases are expressed. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Renewal of rod photoreceptor outer segments in the mammalian eye involves synchronized diurnal shedding after light onset of spent distal outer segment fragments (POS) linked to swift clearance of shed POS from the subretinal space by the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Engulfed POS phagosomes in RPE cells mature to acidified phagolysosomes, which accomplish enzymatic degradation of POS macromolecules. Here, we used an acidophilic fluorophore LysoTracker to label acidic organelles in freshly dissected, live rat RPE tissue flat mounts. We observed that all RPE cells imaged contained numerous acidified POS phagolysosomes whose abundance per cell was dramatically increased 2 h after light onset as compared to either 1 h before or 4 h after light onset. Lack of organelles of similar diameter (of 1ÔÇô2 ╬╝m) in phagocytosis-defective mutant RCS rat RPE confirmed that LysoTracker live imaging detected POS phagolysosomes. Lack of increase in lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 in RPE/choroid during the diurnal phagocytic burst suggests that formation of POS phagolysosomes in RPE in situ may not involve extra lysosome membrane biogenesis. Taken together, we report a new imaging approach that directly detects POS phagosome acidification and allows rapid tracking and quantification of POS phagocytosis by live RPE tissue ex situ. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Retinal degeneration (RD) such as retinitis pigmentosa and agerelated macular degeneration are major causes of blindness in adulthood. As one of the model for RD, intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) is widely used because of its selective photoreceptor cell death. It has been reported that MNU increases intracellular calcium ions in the retina and induces photoreceptor cell death. Although calcium ion influx triggers the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activation, the role of nNOS on photoreceptor cell death by MNU has not been reported yet. In this study, we investigated the contribution of nNOS on photoreceptor cell death induced by MNU in mice. MNU significantly increased NOS activation at 3 day after treatment. Then, we evaluated the effect of nNOS specific inhibitor, ethyl[4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] carbamimidothioate (ETPI) on the MNU-induced photoreceptor cell death. At 3 days, ETPI clearly inhibited the MNU-induced cell death in the ONL. These data indicate that nNOS is a key molecule for pathogenesis of MNU-induced photoreceptor cell death. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Retinitis pigmentosa is a disease characterized by the loss of photoreceptor cells. The N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced retinal degeneration model is widely used to study the mechanism of these retinal degenerative disorders because of its selective photoreceptor cell death. As for the cell death mechanism of MNU, calcium-calpain activation and lipid peroxidation processes are involved in the initiation of this cell death. Although such molecular mechanisms of the MNU-induced cell death have been described, the total image of the cell death is still obscure. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) has been shown to function as a chaperon molecule to protect cells against environmental and physiological stresses. In this study, we investigated the effect of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), an accylic polyisoprenoid, on MNU-induced photoreceptor cell loss. HSP70 induction by GGA was effective against MNU-induced photoreceptor cell loss as a result of its ability to prevent HSP70 degradation. The data indicate that GGA may help to suppress the onset and progression of retinitis pigmentosa. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Thyroid hormone (TH) signaling regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the retina, TH signaling plays a central role in cone opsin expression. TH signaling inhibits S opsin expression, stimulates M opsin expression, and promotes dorsal-ventral opsin patterning. TH signaling has also been associated with cone photoreceptor viability. Treatment with thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) or induction of high T3 by deleting the hormone-inactivating enzyme type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO3) causes cone death in mice. This effect is reversed by deletion of the TH receptor (TR) gene. Consistent with the T3 treatment effect, suppressing TH signaling preserves cones in mouse models of retinal degeneration. The regulation of cone survival by TH signaling appears to be independent of its regulatory role in cone opsin expression. The mechanism by which TH signaling regulates cone viability remains to be identified. The current understanding of TH signaling regulation in photoreceptor viability suggests that suppressing TH signaling locally in the retina may represent a novel strategy for retinal degeneration management. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"All mammalian cell membranes are characterized by amphipathic lipid molecules that interact with proteins to confer structural and functional properties on the cell. The predominant lipid species are phospholipids, glycolipids, sphingolipids and cholesterol. These lipids contain fatty acids with variable hydrocarbon chain lengths between C14-C40, either saturated or unsaturated, that are derived from diet, synthesized de novo, or elongated from shorter chain fatty acids by fatty acid elongase enzymes. One member of the family of elongases, ELOngation of Very Long chain fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4), mediates the biosynthesis of both saturated and unsaturated very long chain fatty acids (VLC-FA; > C26) in the retina, meibomian gland, brain, skin, and testis. Different mutations in ELOVL4 cause tissue-specific maculopathy and/or neuro-ichthyotic disorders. The goal of this mini-review is to highlight how different mutations in ELOVL4 can cause variable phenotypic disorder, and propose a possible mechanism, based on the role of fatty acids in membranes, which could explain the different phenotypes. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell migration in response to disease has been reported for age-related macular degeneration, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The complex molecular process of RPE cell migration is regulated in part by growth factors and cytokines, and activation of the PI3/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Rapamycin, an allosteric mTOR inhibitor, has been shown to block only one of the primary downstream mTOR effectors, p70 S6 kinase 1, in many cell types. INK128, a selective mTOR ATP binding site competitor, blocks both p70 S6 kinase 1 and a second primary downstream effector, 4E-BP1. We performed scratch assays using differentiated ARPE-19 and primary porcine RPE cells to assess the effect of mTOR inhibition on cell migration. We found that INK128-mediated blocking of both p70 S6 kinase 1 and 4E-BP1 was much more effective at preventing RPE cell migration than rapamycin-mediated inhibition of p70 S6 kinase 1 alone. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"High content analysis (HCA) has become a leading methodology in phenotypic drug discovery efforts. Typical HCA workflows include imaging cells using an automated microscope and analyzing the data using algorithms designed to quantify one or more specific phenotypes of interest. Due to the richness of high content data, unappreciated phenotypic changes may be discovered in existing image sets using interactive machine-learning based software systems. Primary postnatal day four retinal cells from the photoreceptor (PR) labeled QRX-EGFP reporter mice were isolated, seeded, treated with a set of 234 profiled kinase inhibitors and then cultured for 1 week. The cells were imaged with an Acumen platebased laser cytometer to determine the number and intensity of GFP-expressing, i.e. PR, cells. Wells displaying intensities and counts above threshold values of interest were re-imaged at a higher resolution with an INCell2000 automated microscope. The images were analyzed with an open source HCA analysis tool, PhenoRipper (Rajaram et al., Nat Methods 9:635ÔÇô637, 2012), to identify the high GFP-inducing treatments that additionally resulted in diverse phenotypes compared to the vehicle control samples. The pyrimidinopyrimidone kinase inhibitor CHEMBL-1766490, a pan kinase inhibitor whose major known targets are p38╬▒ and the Src family member lck, was identified as an inducer of photoreceptor neuritogenesis by using the open-source HCA program PhenoRipper. This finding was corroborated using a cell-based method of image analysis that measures quantitative differences in the mean neurite length in GFP expressing cells. Interacting with data using machine learning algorithms may complement traditional HCA approaches by leading to the discovery of small molecule-induced cellular phenotypes in addition to those upon which the investigator is initially focusing. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"We are interested in the roles of epigenetic mechanisms in retinal development. By ChIP-qPCR using whole retinal extracts at various developmental stages, we found that the levels of methylation of histones H3K27 and H3K4 and acetylation of histone H3 at specific loci in various genes, which play critical roles in retinal proliferation and differentiation, changed dramatically during retinal development. We next focused on the roles of H3K27 trimethylation in retinal development. Ezh1 and Ezh2 are methyltransferases that act on H3K27, while Jmjd3 and Utx are demethylases. We found that Ezh2 and Jmjd3 were mainly expressed during retinal development, and a loss-of-function of these genes revealed a role for H3K27me3 in the maturation of subsets of bipolar cells. Furthermore, Ezh2 and Jmjd3 regulate H3K27 trimethylation at specific loci within Bhlhb4 and Vsx1, which play critical roles in the differentiation of subsets of bipolar cells. Utx is expressed weakly in retina, and the down-regulation of Utx by sh-RNA in retinal explants suggested that Utx also participates in the maturation of bipolar cells. Ezh1 is expressed weakly in postnatal retina, and the phenotype of Ezh2-knockout retina suggested that Ezh1 plays a role in the methylation of H3K27 in the late phase of retinal differentiation. Taken together, we found that these four genes, which exhibit temporally and spatially unique expression patterns during retinal development, play critical roles in the differentiation of retinal subsets through the regulation of histone H3K27 methylation at critical genetic loci. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Innate immunity represents the first line of host defense against extracellular infections. Timely initiation of inflammatory responses to invading pathogens confers host the ability to prevent, restrict, and eliminate microorganisms and further trigger adaptive immunity to provide extended eradication of the pathogens as well as long-term protection of the host from recurrent infections. During this process, various types of cytokines are required for efficient immune responses, and interleukin 17 (IL-17) is one of them. The IL-17 family of cytokines bridges innate and adaptive immune responses and play an essential role in defining the Th17 cell lineage differentiation and function. Th17 cells have pivotal roles in protecting the host against extracellular pathogens as well as in promoting inflammatory pathology in autoimmune diseases. Strict regulation of the IL-17 family of cytokines at different levels ensures appropriate controls of their abilities to shape immune responses. This chapter provides the recent progress in the field of IL-17 studies for the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in the expression and signaling of the IL-17 family cytokines. IL-17A (IL-17) is the most well-studied member in this family, while information on the other members is relatively sketchy.

"Increased tubular epithelial cell proliferation with fl uid secretion is a key hallmark of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). With disruption of either PKD1 or PKD2, the main causative genes of ADPKD, intracellular calcium homeostasis and cAMP accumulation are disrupted, which in turn leads to altered signaling in the pathways that regulate cell proliferation. These dysregulations finally stimulate the development of fluid-filled cysts originating from abnormally proliferating renal tubular cells. In addition, dysregulated apoptosis is observed in dilated cystic tubules. An imbalance between cell proliferation and apoptosis seems to contribute to cyst growth and renal tissue remodeling in ADPKD. In this section, the mechanisms through which cell proliferation and apoptosis are involved in disease progression, and further, how those signaling pathways impinge on each other in ADPKD will be discussed. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016."
"Mutations in the BEST1 gene lead to a variety of retinal degenerations including BestÔÇÖs vitelliforme macular degeneration. The BEST1 gene product, bestrophin-1, is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). It is likely that mutant bestrophin-1 impairs functions of the RPE which support photoreceptor function and will thus lead to retinal degeneration. However, the RPE function which is influenced by bestrophin-1 is so far not identified. Previously we showed that bestrophin-1 interacts with L-type Ca2++ channels of the CaV1.3 subtype and that the endogenously expressed bestrophin-1 is required for intracellular Ca2++ regulation. A hallmark of BestÔÇÖs disease is the fast lipofuscin accumulation occurring already at young ages. Therefore, we addressed the hypothesis that bestrophin-1 might influence phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by the RPE. Here, siRNA knock-down of bestrophin-1 expression as well as inhibition of L-type Ca2++ channel activity modulated the POS phagocytosis in vitro. In vivo CaV1.3 expression appeared to be diurnal regulated with a higher expression rate in the afternoon. Compared to wild-type littermates, CaV1.3ÔêÆ/ÔêÆ mice showed a shift in the circadian POS phagocytosis with an increased activity in the afternoon. Thus we suggest that mutant bestrophin-1 leads to an impaired regulation of the POS phagocytosis by the RPE which would explain the fast lipofuscin accumulation in Best patients. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a multifactorial progressive degenerative disease of the retinal photoreceptors, pigmented epithelium and BruchÔÇÖs membrane/choroid in central retina, causes visual impairment in millions of elderly people worldwide. The only available therapy for this disease is the over-the-counter (OTC) multi-vitamins plus macular xanthophyll (lutein/zeaxanthin) which attempts to block the damages of oxidative stress and ionizing blue light. Therefore development of dry AMD prescribed treatment is a pressing unmet medical need. However, this effort is currently hindered by many challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis that leads to uncertain targets, confounded by not yet validated preclinical models and the difficulty to deliver the drugs to the posterior segment of the eye. Additionally, with slow disease progression and a less than ideal endpoint measurement method, clinical trials are necessarily large, lengthy and expensive. Increased commitment to research and development is an essential foundation for dealing with these problems. Innovations in clinical trials with novel endpoints, nontraditional study designs and the use of surrogate diseases might shorten the study time, reduce the patient sample size and consequently lower the budget for the development of the new therapies for the dry AMD. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Interleukin-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced primarily by pathogen-activated antigen-presenting cells, particularly macrophages and dendritic cells, during encountering with intracellular microbes. IL-12 plays a key role in the activation of natural killer cells and CD4+ T helper cells in both innate and adaptive immune responses against infectious agents and immunosurveillance against endogenous malignancies. However, the potency of IL-12 makes it a target for stringent regulation. Indeed, the temporal, spatial, and quantitative expression of IL-12 during an immune response in a microenvironment contributes critically to the determination of the type, extent, and ultimate resolution of the reaction. Breaching of the delicate control and balance involving IL-12 frequently leads to autoimmune inflammatory disorders and pathogenesis. Thus, a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in the production and control of this cytokine is both scientifically significant and clinically beneficial.

"Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are an extremely heterogeneous group of genetic diseases for which currently no effective treatment strategies exist. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made utilizing gene augmentation therapy for a few genetic subtypes of IRD, although several technical challenges so far prevent a broad clinical application of this approach for other forms of IRD. Many of the mutations leading to these retinal diseases affect pre-mRNA splicing of the mutated genes. Antisense oligonucleotide (AON)-mediated splice modulation appears to be a powerful approach to correct the consequences of such mutations at the pre-mRNA level, as demonstrated by promising results in clinical trials for several inherited disorders like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hypercholesterolemia and various types of cancer. In this mini-review, we summarize ongoing pre-clinical research on AON-based therapy for a few genetic subtypes of IRD, speculate on other potential therapeutic targets, and discuss the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead to translate splice modulation therapy for retinal disorders to the clinic. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Interleukin (IL)-10 is an essential anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays important roles as a negative regulator of immune responses to microbial antigens. Loss of IL-10 results in the spontaneous development of infl ammatory bowel disease as a consequence of an excessive immune response to the gut microbiota. IL-10 also functions to prevent excessive inflammation during the course of infection. IL-10 can be produced in response to pro-inflammatory signals by virtually all immune cells, including T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Given its function in maintaining the delicate balance between effective immunity and tissue protection, it is evident that IL-10 expression is highly dynamic and needs to be tightly regulated. The transcriptional regulation of IL-10 production in myeloid cells and T cells is the topic of this review. Drivers of IL-10 expression as well as their downstream signaling pathways and transcription factors will be discussed. We will examine in more detail how various signals in CD4+ T cells converge on common transcriptional circuits, which fine-tune IL-10 expression in a contextdependent manner. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016."

This chapter provides the algorithms of metabolite PBPK modeling and simulation in the Simcyp Simulator. It focuses on the full PBPK model for both parent compound and its metabolites. The chapter mainly focuses on the formation/absorption, distribution, elimination, and DDIs of metabolites. Modeling of metabolite PK can become even more complex if the metabolite, for example, is transformed back to the parent compound. Such back-conversion is common for the metabolites of corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone and methylprednisone) and sulfonamides, as well as for acyl glucuronide metabolites. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

"This chapter describes the strategies and tactics that can be used in in vivo studies to help provide the required knowledge and understanding of in vivo metabolism, especially in humans, to provide the best outcomes for candidate drugs as they progress through development and toward clinical use. A final preparation for the human radiolabeled study is to perform a quantitative tissue distribution study which is most often satisfied by performing a quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) study. Where metabolism is thought to be primarily undertaken in the liver, the chimeric humanized mouse model may represent a very useful means of investigating human-specific drug metabolism. Transgenic mice have been developed that are humanized in the liver (or gut) for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa), and pregnane X receptor (PXR), all of which have importance in drug metabolism. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

"This chapter focuses on topical administration to the skin. Topical drugs may exert their effect either locally or systemically or both. Upon administration they are designed to penetrate into the skin and may also permeate through the skin to reach the systemic circulation. Safety testing of topically applied drugs therefore comprises of two components, the local skin exposure and the systemic exposure of parent drug and metabolites. The chapter includes a literature review of the current knowledge of metabolic enzymes in human skin and various skin models and also touches upon metabolic differences in diseased human skin and between human and animal species. Knowledge of local metabolism in the skin may be used actively by the medicinal chemist to design substances which are efficacious locally and likely less toxic when entering into the systemic circulation. The chapter specifically discusses safety testing of topical drugs. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved."
"The success of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods for DNA-damaging carcinogens detection highlights the need to understand the mechanisms by which reactive metabolite (RM) formation can cause toxicity when attempting to undertake hazard and risk assessment. Some of the target organ toxicities caused by RMs are highly reproducible and dose dependent and can readily be reproduced in various preclinical species, as well as in humans. These are referred to as ""type A"" or intrinsic toxicities. In addition, RMs are an important cause of ""type B"" or idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IADRs). These affect the liver and/or other target organs. This chapter discusses the methods that available currently for prediction, assessment, and minimization of RM formation, which can be used to undertake risk assessment. Covalent Binding (CVB) has been a valuable tool in the assessment of reactivity of molecules and their metabolites and an important part of RM risk assessment strategies. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

"Honokiol (C18H18O2) is a biphenolic natural product isolated from the bark and leaves of Magnolia plant spp. During the last decade or more, honokiol has been extensively studied for its beneficial effect against several diseases. Investigations have demonstrated that honokiol possesses anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-angiogenic as well as inhibitory effect on malignant transformation of papillomas to carcinomas in vitro and in vivo animal models without any appreciable toxicity. Honokiol affects multiple signaling pathways, molecular and cellular targets including nuclear factor-╬║B (NF-╬║B), STAT3, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cell survival signaling, cell cycle, cyclooxygenase and other inflammatory mediators, etc. Its chemopreventive and/or therapeutic effects have been tested against chronic diseases, such as cancers of different organs. In this chapter, we describe and discuss briefly the effect of honokiol against cancers of different organs, such as melanoma, non-melanoma, lung, prostate, breast, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urinary bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and neuroblastoma, etc. and describe its mechanism of action including various molecular and cellular targets. Although more rigorous in vivo studies are still needed, however it is expected that therapeutic effects and activities of honokiol may help in the development and designing of clinical trials against chronic diseases in human subjects. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a common phytochemical in cruciferous vegetables, and its condensation product, 3, 3ÔÇÖ-diindolylmethane (DIM) exert several biological activities on cellular and molecular levels, which contribute to their well-recognized chemoprevention potential. Initially, these compounds were classified as blocking agents that increase drug-metabolizing enzyme activity. Now it is widely accepted that I3C and DIM affect multiple signaling pathways and target molecules controlling cell division, apoptosis, or angiogenesis deregulated in cancer cells. Although most of the current data support the role of I3C and DIM in prevention of hormone-dependent cancers, it seems that their application in prevention of the other cancer as well as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes reduction is also possible. This chapter summarizes the current experimental data on the I3C and DIM activity and the results of clinical studies indicating their role in prevention of chronic diseases. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Curcumin, a yellow pigment from the spice turmeric, is used in Indian and Chinese medicine since ancient times for wide range of diseases. Extensive scientific research on this molecule performed over the last 3 to 4 decades has proved its potential as an important pharmacological agent. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and chemopreventive activities of curcumin have been extended to explore this molecule against many chronic diseases with promising results. Further, its multitargeting ability and nontoxic nature to humans even up to 12 g/day have attracted scientists to explore this as an anticancer agent in the clinic, which is in different phases of trials. With much more scope to be investigated and understood, curcumin becomes one of the very few inexpensive botanical molecules with potent therapeutic abilities. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Kokum, a spice derived from the fruit of the Garcinia hanburyi tree, is traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicines to facilitate digestion and to treat sores, dermatitis, diarrhoea, dysentery, and ear infection. One of the major active components of kokum is gambogic acid, also known as guttic acid, guttatic acid, beta-guttilactone, and beta-guttiferin. Gambogic acidÔÇÖs anti-proliferative, anti-bacterial; antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects result from its modulation of numerous cell-signaling intermediates.

"The various bioactive compounds isolated from leaves and fruits of Garcinia sps plants, have beencharacterized and experimentally demonstrated to be anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer in nature.Garcinol, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone, obtained from plant Garcinia indica has been found to be aneffective inhibitor of several key regulatory pathways (e.g., NF-kB, STAT3 etc.) in cancer cells, thereby being ableto control malignant growth of solid tumours in vivo. Despite its high potential as an anti-neoplastic modulator ofseveral cancer types such as head and neck cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, colon cancer etc., it is still in preclinical stage due to lack of systematic and conclusive evaluation ofpharmacological parameters. While it is promising anti-cancer effects are being positively ascertained fortherapeutic development, studies on its effectiveness in ameliorating other chronic diseases such ascardiovascular diseases, diabetes, allergy, neurodegenerative diseases etc., though seem favourable, are veryrecent and require in depth scientific investigation. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Automatic analysis of increasingly growing literature repositories including data integration to other databases is a powerful tool to propose hypothesis that can be used to plan experiments to validate or disprove the hypothesis. Furthermore, it provides means to evaluate the redundancy of research line in comparison to the published literature. This is potentially beneficial for those developing research in a specific disease which are interested in exploring a particular pathway or set of genes/proteins. In the scope of the integrating book a case will be made addressing proteostasis factors in cancer. The maintenance of proteome homeostasis, known as proteostasis, is a process by which cells regulate protein translation, degradation, subcellular localization, and protein folding and consists of an integrated network of proteins. The ubiquitin- proteasome system plays a key role in essential biological processes such as cell cycle, DNA damage repair, membrane trafficking, and maintaining protein homeostasis. Cells maintain proteostasis by regulating protein translation, degradation, subcellular localization, and protein folding. Aberrant proteostasis leads to loss-of-function diseases (cystic fibrosis) and gain-of-toxic-function diseases (AlzheimerÔÇÖs, ParkinsonÔÇÖs, and HuntingtonÔÇÖs disease). Cancer therapy on the other hand explores inhibition of proteostasis factors to trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress with subsequent apoptosis. Alternatively therapies target deubiquitinases and thereby regulate tumor promoters or suppressors. Furthermore, mutations in specific proteostasis factors are associated with higher risk for specific cancers, e.g., BRCA mutations in breast cancer. This chapter discusses proteostasis protein factorsÔÇÖ association with cancer from a literature mining perspective. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"Natural compounds isolated from various plant sources have been used for therapeutic purpose for centuries. These compounds have been routinely used for the management of various chronic ailments and have gained considerable attention because of their significant efficacy and comparatively low side effects. Butein, a chacolnoid compound that has been isolated from various medicinal plants has exhibited a wide range of beneficial pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-angiogenic in diverse disease models. This article briefly summarizes the past published literature related to the therapeutic and protective effects of butein, as demonstrated in various models of human chronic diseases. Further analysis of its important cellular targets, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic profile may further significantly expand its therapeutic application. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Chronic diseases pose a worldwide problem and are only continuing to increase in incidence. Two major factors contributing to the increased incidence in chronic disease are a lack of physical activity and poor diet. As the link between diet and lifestyle and the increased incidence of chronic disease has been well established in the literature, novel preventive, and therapeutic methods should be aimed at naturally derived compounds such as ursolic acid (UA), the focus of this chapter. As chronic diseases, obesity and cancer share the common thread of inflammation and dysregulation of many related pathways, the focus here will be on these two chronic diseases. Significant evidence in the literature supports an important role for natural compounds such as UA in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases like obesity and cancer, and here we have highlighted many of the ways UA has been shown to be a beneficial and versatile phytochemical. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

"Chronic inflammation is a prolonged and dysregulated immune response leading to a wide variety of physiological and pathological conditions such as neurological abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, pulmonary diseases, immunological diseases, cancers, and other life-threatening conditions. Therefore, inhibition of persistent inflammation will reduce the risk of inflammation-associated chronic diseases. Inflammation-related chronic diseases require chronic treatment without side effects. Use of traditional medicines and restricted diet has been utilized by mankind for ages to prevent or treat several chronic diseases. Bioactive dietary agents or ÔÇ£NutraceuticalsÔÇØ present in several fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fibers, and certain spices have shown potential to inhibit or reverse the inflammatory responses and several chronic diseases related to chronic inflammation. Due to safe, nontoxic, and preventive benefits, the use of nutraceuticals as dietary supplements or functional foods has increased in the Western world. Fisetin (3,3ÔÇ▓,4ÔÇ▓,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a dietary flavonoid found in various fruits (strawberries, apples, mangoes, persimmons, kiwis, and grapes), vegetables (tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers), nuts, and wine that has shown strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-tumorigenic, anti-invasive, anti-angiogenic, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects in cell culture and in animal models relevant to human diseases.

"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an evolutionary conserved complex that is found in all eukaryotes, and implicated in regulating the activity of Cullin-RING ubiquitin Ligases (CRLs). Activity of CRLs is highly regulated; complexes are active when the cullin subunit is covalently attached to the ubiquitin like modifier, Nedd8. Neddylation/deneddylation cycles are required for proper CRLs activity, and deneddylation is performed by the CSN complex. We describe here a method utilizing resin-coupled antibodies to deplete the CSN from human cell extracts, and to obtain endogenous CSN complexes by immunopurification. In the first step, the cross-linked primary antibodies recognize endogenous CSN complexes, and deplete them from cell extract as the extract passes through the immunoaffinity column. The resulting ÔÇ£CSN-depleted extractÔÇØ (CDP) is rich in neddylated cullins that can be used as a substrate for cullin-deneddylation assay for CSN complexes purified from various eukaryotes. Consequently, regeneration of the column results in dissociation of a highly purified CSN complex, together with its associated proteins. Immunopurification of the CSN from various human tissues or experimental conditions is advantageous for the generation of numerous CSN-interaction maps. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"Withanolides, and in particular extracts from Withania somnifera, have been used for over 3, 000 years in traditional Ayurvedic and Unani Indian medical systems as well as within several other Asian countries. Traditionally, the extracts were ascribed a wide range of pharmacologic properties with corresponding medical uses, including adaptogenic, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, sedative/anxiolytic, cytotoxic, antitussive, and immunomodulatory. Since the discovery of the archetype withaferin A in 1965, approximately 900 of these naturally occurring, polyoxygenated steroidal lactones with 28-carbon ergostane skeletons have been discovered across 24 diverse structural types. Subsequently, extensive pharmacologic research has identified multiple mechanisms of action across key inflammatory pathways. In this chapter we identify and describe the major withanolides with anti-inflammatory properties, illustrate their role within essential and supportive inflammatory pathways (including NF-╬║B, JAK/STAT, AP-1, PPAR╬│, Hsp90 Nrf2, and HIF-1), and then discuss the clinical application of these withanolides in inflammation-mediated chronic diseases (including arthritis, autoimmune, cancer, neurodegenerative, and neurobehavioral). These naturally derived compounds exhibit remarkable biologic activity across these complex disease processes, while showing minimal adverse effects. As novel compounds and analogs continue to be discovered, characterized, and clinically evaluated, the interest in withanolides as a novel therapeutic only continues to grow. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"A polypeptide chain can interact with other polypeptide chains and form stable and functional complexes called ÔÇ£oligomers.ÔÇØ Frequently, biochemical analysis of these complexes is made difficult by their great size. Traditionally, size exclusion chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, or immunoprecipitation techniques have been used to isolate oligomers. Components of these oligomers are then further separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Although they are sensitive, these techniques are not easy to perform and reproduce. The use of Tris-acetate polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis allows the simultaneous analysis of proteins in the mass range of 10ÔÇô500 kDa. We have used this characteristic together with cross-linking reagents to analyze the oligomerization of endogenous proteins with a single electrophoretic gel. We demonstrate how the oligomerization of p53, the pyruvate kinase isoform M2, or the heat shock protein 27 can be studied with this system. We also show how this system is useful for studying the oligomerization of large proteins such as clathrin heavy chain or the tuberous sclerosis complex. Oligomerization analysis is dependent on the cross-linker used and its concentration. All of these features make this system a very helpful tool for the analysis of protein oligomerization. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"Celastrol, a triterpenoid derived from traditional Chinese medicinal plants, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. Celastrol has shown preventive/therapeutic effects in experimental models of several chronic diseases. These include, chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis), neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., AlzheimerÔÇÖs disease, ParkinsonÔÇÖs disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), atherosclerosis, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Celastrol modulates intricate cellular pathways and networks associated with disease pathology, and it interrupts or redirects the aberrant cellular and molecular events so as to limit disease progression and facilitate recovery, where feasible. The major cell signaling pathways modulated by celastrol include the NF-kB pathway, MAPK pathway, JAK/STAT pathway, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Furthermore, celastrol modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, proteasome activity, heat-shock protein response, innate and adaptive immune responses, angiogenesis, and bone remodeling. Current understanding of the mechanisms of action of celastrol and information about its disease-modulating activities in experimental models have set the stage for testing celastrol in clinical studies as a therapeutic agent for several chronic human diseases. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

"The attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers to proteins is an important signal for the regulation of a variety of biological processes including the targeting of substrates for degradation, receptor internalization, regulation of gene expression, and DNA repair. Posttranslational modification of proteins by ubiquitin controls many cellular processes, and aberrant ubiquitylation can contribute to cancer, immunopathologies, and neurodegeneration. Thus, deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) that remove ubiquitin from proteins have become attractive therapeutic targets. Monitoring the activity of DUBs in cells or in tissues is critical for understanding the biological function of DUBs in particular pathways and is essential for determining the physiological specificity and potency of small-molecule DUB inhibitors. Here, we describe a method for the homogenization of animal tissues and incubation of tissue lysates with ubiquitin-based activity probes to monitor DUB activity in mouse tissues and target engagement following treatment of animals with small-molecule DUB inhibitors. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."

"Tocotrienol is a member of vitamin E family and is well-known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also a suppressor of mevalonate pathway responsible for cholesterol and prenylated protein synthesis. This review aimed to discuss the health beneficial effects of tocotrienol, specifically in preventing or treating hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and cancer with respect to these properties. Evidence from in vitro, in vivo and human studies has been examined. It is revealed that tocotrienol shows promising effects in preventing or treating the health conditions previously mentioned in in vivo and in vitro models. In some cases, alpha-tocopherol attenuates the biological activity of tocotrienol. Except for its cholesterol-lowering effects, data on the health-promoting effects of tocotrienol in human are limited.

"The use of natural products derived from plants as medicines precedes even the recorded human history. In the past few years there were renewed interests in developing natural compounds and understanding their target specificity for drug development for many devastating human diseases. This has been possible due to remarkable advancements in the development of sensitive chemistry and biology tools. Sanguinarine is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid derived from rhizomes of the plant species Sanguinaria canadensis. The alkaloid can exist in the cationic iminium and neutral alkanolamine forms. Sanguinarine is an excellent DNA and RNA intercalator where only the iminium ion binds. Both forms of the alkaloid, however, shows binding to functional proteins like serum albumins, lysozyme and hemoglobin. The molecule is endowed with remarkable biological activities and large number of studies on its various activities has been published potentiating its development as a therapeutic agent particularly for chronic human diseases like cancer, asthma, etc. In this article, we review the properties of this natural alkaloid, and its diverse medicinal applications in relation to how it modulates cell death signaling pathways and induce apoptosis through different ways, its utility as a therapeutic agent for chronic diseases and its biological effects in animal and human models. These data may be useful to understand the therapeutic potential of this important and highly abundant alkaloid that may aid in the development of sanguinarine-based therapeutic agents with high efficacy and specificity. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

"DNA-based technologies such as RNAi, chemical-genetic profiling, or gene expression profiling by DNA microarrays combined with other biochemical methods are established strategies for surveying drug mechanisms. Such approaches can provide mechanistic information on how drugs act and affect cellular pathways. By studying how cancer cells compensate for the drug treatment, novel targets used in a combined treatment can be designed. Furthermore, toxicity effects on cells not targeted can be obtained on a molecular level. For example, drug companies are particularly interested in studying the molecular side effects of drugs in the liver. In addition, experiments with the purpose of elucidating liver toxicity can be studied using samples obtained from animal models exposed to different concentrations of a drug over time. More recently considerable advances in mass spectrometry (MS) technologies and bioinformatics tools allows informative global drug profiling experiments to be performed at a cost comparable to other large-scale technologies such as DNA-based technologies. Moreover, MS-based proteomics provides an additional layer of information on the dynamic regulation of proteins translation and particularly protein degradation. MS-based proteomics approaches combined with other biochemical methods delivers information on regulatory networks, signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways upon drug treatment. Furthermore, MS-based proteomics can provide additional information on single amino acid polymorphisms, protein isoform distribution, posttranslational modifications, and subcellular localization. In this chapter, we will share our experience using MS based proteomics as a pharmacoproteomics strategy to characterize drug mechanisms of action in single drug therapy or in multidrug combination.

"The field of toxicity testing for non-pharmaceutical chemicals is in flux with multiple initiatives in North America and the EU to move away from animal testing to mode-of-action based in vitro assays. In this arena, there are still obstacles to overcome, such as developing appropriate cellular assays, creating pathwaybased dose-response models and refining in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) tools. Overall, it is necessary to provide assurances that these new approaches are adequately protective of human and ecological health. Another major challenge for individual scientists and regulatory agencies is developing a cultural willingness to shed old biases developed around animal tests and become more comfortable with mode-of-action based assays in human cells. At present, most initiatives focus on developing in vitro alternatives and assessing how well these alternative methods reproduce past results related to predicting organism level toxicity in intact animals. The path forward requires looking beyond benchmarking against high dose animal studies. We need to develop targeted cellular assays, new cell biology-based extrapolation models for assessing regions of safety for chemical exposures in human populations, and mode-of-action-based approaches which are constructed on an understanding of human biology. Furthermore, it is essential that assay developers have the flexibility to ÔÇÿvalidateÔÇÖ against the most appropriate mode-of-action data rather than against apical endpoints in high dose animal studies.

"Chronic diseases can be referred to the long-term medical conditions which are mostly progressive in nature, i.e., it deteriorates over time. Diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and chronic respiratory problems (e.g., COPD) are not a few examples of chronic diseases and chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability all over the world. Chronic diseases and conditions are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems. Affordable cost, presence mostly in the consumables, and minimal side effects make the naturally occurring compounds interesting and attractive for pharmacological study in recent years. Plants produce diverse types of low molecular weight products mainly for the defense purpose. Among them, the group of secondary metabolites related to a polyphenolic group has been named flavonoids and are of great interest due to their incredible pharmacological properties. In these regard, due to its potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and many important pharmacological properties (relevant to chronic diseases, e.g., urate transporter inhibitor related to gout, modulator of immunosystem related to chronic hypersensitivity, etc.), morin [morin hydrate:2-(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3, 5, 7-trihydroxy-4H-1-benzopy ran-4-one; 3, 5, 7, 20, 40 pentahydroxyflavone], widely found among the Moraceae family, considered as one of the most important key bioflavonols.

"Different biochemical techniques are well established to investigate targetÔÇÖs ubiquitination in mammals without overexpressing a tagged version of ubiquitin (Ub). The simplest and more direct approach is to immunoprecipitate (IP) your target protein from cell lysate (stimulated and/or properly treated), followed by western blot analysis utilizing specifi c antibodies against Ub (see Subheading 3.1). This approach requires a good antibody against the target working in IP; alternatively, one could express a tagged version of the protein, possibly at the endogenous level. Another approach consists in IP ubiquitinated proteins from total cell lysate followed by detection with the antibody against the protein of interest. This second method relies on the availability of specifi c and very effi cient antibodies against Ub (see Subheading 3.2). A more quantitative approach is the DELFIA assay (Perkin Elmer), an ELISA-based assay, which allows comparing more samples and conditions (see Subheading 3.3). Cross-validation with more than one approach is usually recommended in order to prove that your protein is modifi ed by ubiquitin.

"Sumoylation is a posttranslational process essential for life and concerns a growing number of crucial proteins. Understanding the influence of this phenomenon on individual proteins or on cellular pathways in which they function has become an intense area of research. A critical step in studying protein sumoylation is to detect sumoylated forms of a particular protein. This has proven to be a challenging task for a number of reasons, especially in the case of endogenous proteins and in vivo studies or when studying rare cells such as stem cells. Proximity ligation assays that allow detection of closely interacting protein partners can be adapted for initial detection of endogenous sumoylation or ubiquitination in a rapid, ultrasensitive, and cheap manner. In addition, modified forms of a given protein can be detected in situ in various cellular compartments. Finally, the flexibility of this technique may allow rapid screening of drugs and stress signals that may modulate protein sumoylation. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."

"Deubiquitylating enzymes or DUBs are a class of enzymes that selectively remove the polypeptide posttranslational modification ubiquitin from a number of substrates. Approximately 100 DUBs exist in human cells and are involved in key regulatory cellular processes, which drive many disease states, making them attractive therapeutic targets. Several aspects of DUB biology have been studied through genetic knock- out or knock-down, genomic, or proteomic studies. However, investigation of enzyme activation and regulation requires additional tools to monitor cellular and physiological dynamics. A comparison between genetic ablation and dominant-negative target validation with pharmacological inhibition often leads to striking discrepancies. Activity probes have been used to profile classes of enzymes, including DUBs, and allow functional and dynamic properties to be assigned to individual proteins. The ability to directly monitor DUB activity within a native biological system is essential for understanding the physiological and pathological role of individual DUBs. We will discuss the evolution of DUB activity probes, from in vitro assay development to their use in monitoring DUB activity in cells and in animal tissues, as well as recent progress and prospects for assessing DUB inhibition in vivo. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"Ubiquitination pathways are widely used within eukaryotic cells. The complexity of ubiquitin signaling gives rise to a number of problems in the study of specific pathways. One problem is that not all processes regulated by ubiquitin are shared among the different cells of an organism (e.g., neurotransmitter release is only carried out in neuronal cells). Moreover, these processes are often highly temporally dynamic. It is essential therefore to use the right system for each biological question, so that we can characterize pathways specifically in the tissue or cells of interest. However, low stoichiometry, and the unstable nature of many ubiquitin conjugates, presents a technical barrier to studying this modification in vivo. Here, we describe two approaches to isolate ubiquitinated proteins to high purity. The first one favors isolation of the whole mixture of ubiquitinated material from a given tissue or cell type, generating a survey of the ubiquitome landscape for a specific condition. The second one favors the isolation of just one specific protein, in order to facilitate the characterization of its ubiquitinated fraction. In both cases, highly stringent denaturing buffers are used to minimize the presence of contaminating material in the sample. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
Mucin-type O-glycosylation occurring in the Golgi apparatus is an important protein posttranslational modification initiated by up to 20 GalNAc-transferase isozymes with largely distinct substrate specificities. Regulation of this enzyme family affects a vast array of proteins transiting the secretory pathway and misregulation causes human diseases. Here we describe the use of protein-based fluorescence sensors that traffic in the secretory pathway to monitor GalNAc-transferase activity in living cells. The sensors can either be ÔÇ£panÔÇØ or isozyme specific. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.
"Mass spectrometry-based approaches are utilized with increasing frequency to facilitate identification of novel SUMO target proteins and to elucidate the dynamics of SUMOylation in response to cellular stresses. Here, we describe a robust method for the identification of SUMO target proteins, and the relative quantification of SUMOylation dynamics, using a label-free approach. The method relies on a decahistidine (His 10 )-tagged SUMO, which is expressed at a low level in a mammalian cell line or model organism. The His 10 -tag allows for a single-step, high-yield, and high-purity enrichment of SUMOylated proteins, which are then digested and analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Matching between runs and labelfree quantification integrated in the freely available MaxQuant software allow for a high rate and accuracy of quantification, providing a strong alternative to laborious sample or cell labeling techniques. The method described here allows for identification of >1000 SUMO target proteins, and characterization of their SUMOylation dynamics, without requiring sample fractionation. The purification procedure, starting from total lysate, can be performed in ~4 days. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"Ubiquitination is a dynamic and reversible posttranslational modifi cation. Much effort has been devoted to characterize the function of ubiquitin pathway genes in the cell context, but much less is known on their functional role in the development and maintenance of organs and tissues in the organism. In fact, several ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are implicated in human pathological disorders, from cancer to neurodegeneration. The aim of our work is to explore the relevance of DUBs in retinal function in health and disease, particularly since some genes related to the ubiquitin or SUMO pathways cause retinal dystrophies, a group of rare diseases that affect 1:3000 individuals worldwide. We propose zebrafi sh as an extremely useful and informative genetic model to characterize the function of any particular gene in the retina, and thus complement the expression data from mouse. A preliminary characterization of gene expression in mouse retinas (RT-PCR and in situ hybridization) was performed to select particularly interesting genes, and we later replicated the experiments in zebrafi sh. As a proof of concept, we selected ups45 to be knocked down by morpholino injection in zebrafi sh embryos. Morphant phenotypic analysis showed moderate to severe eye morphological defects, with a defective formation of the retinal structures, therefore supporting the relevance of DUBs in the formation and differentiation of the vertebrate retina, and suggesting that genes encoding ubiquitin pathway enzymes are good candidates for causing hereditary retinal dystrophies. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"The field of transcriptomics has expanded rapidly during the last decades. This methodology provides an exceptional framework to study not only molecular changes underlying the adverse effects of a given compound, but also to understand its Mode of Action (MoA). However, the implementation of transcriptomics-based tests within the regulatory arena is not a straightforward process. One of the major obstacles in their regulatory implementation is still the interpretation of this new class of data and the judgment of the level of confi dence of these tests. A key element in the regulatory acceptance of transcriptomics-based tests is validation, which still represents a major challenge. Although important advances have been made in the development and standardisation of such tests, to date there is limited experience with their validation. Taking into account the experience acquired so far, this chapter describes those aspects that were identifi ed as important in the validation process of transcriptomics-based tests, including the assessment of standardisation, reliability and relevance. It also critically discusses the challenges posed to validation in relation to the specifi c characteristics of these approaches and their application in the wider context of testing strategies. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"The Golgi complex of mammalian cells is composed of stacks of flattened cisternae that are connected by tubules to form a continuous membrane system, also known as the Golgi ribbon. At the onset of mitosis, the Golgi ribbon is progressively fragmented into small tubular-vesicular clusters and it is reconstituted before completion of cytokinesis. The investigation of the mechanisms behind this reversible cycle of disassembly and reassembly has led to the identification of structural Golgi proteins and regulators. Moreover, these studies allowed to discover that disassembly of the ribbon is necessary for cell entry into mitosis. Here, we describe an in vitro assay that reproduces the mitotic Golgi fragmentation and that has been successfully employed to identify many important mechanisms and proteins involved in the mitotic Golgi reorganization. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) is one of the major orchestrators of the cell division cycle in mammalian cells. The APC/C acts as a ubiquitin ligase that triggers sequential ubiquitylation of a significant number of substrates which will be eventually degraded by proteasomes during major transitions of the cell cycle. In this chapter, we present accessible methodologies to assess both in in vitro conditions and in cellular systems ubiquitylation reactions mediated by the APC/C. In addition, we also describe techniques to evidence the changes in protein stability provoked by modulation of the activity of the APC/C. Finally, specific methods to analyze interactors or posttranslational modifications of particular APC/C subunits are also discussed. Given the crucial role played by the APC/C in the regulation of the cell cycle, this review only focuses on its action and effects in actively proliferating cells. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"Evidence-based toxicology (EBT) was introduced independently by two groups in 2005, in the context of toxicological risk assessment and causation as well as based on parallels between the evaluation of test methods in toxicology and evidence- based assessment of diagnostics tests in medicine. The role model of evidence- based medicine (EBM) motivated both proposals and guided the evolution of EBT, whereas especially systematic reviews and evidence quality assessment attract considerable attention in toxicology. Regarding test assessment, in the search of solutions for various problems related to validation, such as the imperfectness of the reference standard or the challenge to comprehensively evaluate tests, the fi eld of Diagnostic Test Assessment (DTA) was identifi ed as a potential resource. DTA being an EBM discipline, test method assessment/ validation therefore became one of the main drivers spurring the development of EBT. In the context of pathway-based toxicology, EBT approaches, given their objectivity, transparency and consistency, have been proposed to be used for carrying out a (retrospective) mechanistic validation. In summary, implementation of more evidence-based approaches may provide the tools necessary to adapt the assessment/validation of toxicological test methods and testing strategies to face the challenges of toxicology in the twenty fi rst century. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Quality control of cell cultures used in new in vitro toxicology assays is crucial to the provision of reliable, reproducible and accurate toxicity data on new drugs or constituents of new consumer products. This chapter explores the key scientific and ethical criteria that must be addressed at the earliest stages of developing toxicology assays based on human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines. It also identifies key considerations for such assays to be acceptable for regulatory, laboratory safety and commercial purposes. Also addressed is the development of hPSC-based assays for the tissue and cell types of greatest interest in drug toxicology. The chapter draws on a range of expert opinion within the European Commission/Cosmetics Europe-funded alternative testing cluster SEURAT-1 and consensus from international groups delivering this guidance such as the International Stem Cell Banking Initiative. Accordingly, the chapter summarizes the most up-date best practices in the use and quality control of human Pluripotent Stem Cell lines in the development of in vitro toxicity assays from leading experts in the field. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Boswellic acids, which are pentacyclic triterpenes belong to the active pharmacological compounds of the oleogum resin of different Boswellia species. In the resin, more than 12 different boswellic acids have been identified but only KBA and AKBA received significant pharmacological interest. Biological Activity: In an extract of the resin of Boswellia species multiple factors are responsible for the final outcome of a therapeutic effect, be it synergistic or antagonistic. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory actions of BAs are caused by different mechanisms of action. They include inhibition of leukotriene synthesis and to a less extend prostaglandin synthesis. Furthermore inhibition of the complement system at the level of conversion of C3 into C3a and C3b. A major target of BAs is the immune system. Here, BEs as well as BAs including KBA and AKBA, have been shown to decrease production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-╬│ and TNF-╬▒ which finally are directed to destroy tissues such as cartilage, insulin producing cells, bronchial, intestinal and other tissues. NF─©B is considered to be the target of AKBA. The complex actions of BEs and BAs in inflamed areas may be completed by some effects that are localized behind the inflammatory process as such tissue destruction. In this case, in vitro- and animal studies have shown that BAs and BEs suppress proteolytic activity of cathepsin G, human leucocyte elastase, formation of oxygen radicals and lysosomal enzymes. Pharmacokinetics: Whereas KBA is absorbed reaching blood levels being close to in vitro IC50, AKBA which is more active in in vitro studies than KBA, but undergoes much less absorption than KBA. However, absorption of both is increased more than twice when taken together with a high-fat meal.Clinical Studies There are a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases which respond to treatment with extracts from the resin of Boswellia species. Though, the number of cases is small in related clinical studies, their results are convincing and supported by the preclinical data. These studies include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic colitis, ulcerative colitis, collagenous colitis, CrohnÔÇÖs disease and bronchial asthma. It can not be expected that there is cure from these diseases but at least improvement of symptoms in about 60-70 % of the cases. Side Effects The number and severity of side effects is extremely low. The most reported complaints are gastrointestinal symptoms. Allergic reactions are rare. And most authors report, that treatment with BEs is well tolerated and the registered side effects in BE- and placebo groups are similar. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of isoquinoline alkaloids. It is found in such plants as Berberis [e.g. Berberis aquifolium (Oregon grape), Berberis vulgaris (barberry), Berberis aristata (tree turmeric)], Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal), Xanthorhiza simplicissima (yellowroot), Phellodendron amurense[2] (Amur corktree), Coptis chinensis (Chinese goldthread), Tinospora cordifolia, Argemone mexicana (prickly poppy) and Eschscholzia californica (Californian poppy). In vitro it exerts significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. In animal models berberine has neuroprotective and cardiovascular protective effects. In humans, its lipid-lowering and insulin-resistance improving actions have clearly been demonstrated in numerous randomized clinical trials. Moreover, preliminary clinical evidence suggest the ability of berberine to reduce endothelial inflammation improving vascular health, even in patients already affected by cardiovascular diseases. Altogether the available evidences suggest a possible application of berberine use in the management of chronic cardiometabolic disorders. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
"Aging is a biological process accompanied by gradual increase of damage in all cellular macromolecules, i.e., nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. When the proteostasis network (chaperones and proteolytic systems) cannot reverse the damage load due to its excess as compared to cellular repair/regeneration capacity, failure of homeostasis is established. This failure is a major hallmark of aging and/or aggregation-related diseases. Dysfunction of the major cellular proteolytic machineries, namely the proteasome and the lysosome, has been reported during the progression of aging and aggregation-prone diseases. Therefore, activation of these pathways is considered as a possible preventive or therapeutic approach against the progression of these processes. This chapter focuses on UPS activation studies in cellular and organismal models and the effects of such activation on aging, longevity and disease prevention or reversal. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."
"Equipment and device qualification and test assay validation in the field of tissue engineered human organs for substance assessment remain formidable tasks with only a few successful examples so far. The hurdles seem to increase with the growing complexity of the biological systems, emulated by the respective models.

"Increasing societal expectations for new drugs, lack of confidence in short-term endpoints related to long- term outcomes for chronic neurological and psychiatric diseases and rising costs of development in an increasing cost-constrained market all have created a sense of crisis in CNS drug development. New approaches are needed. For some time, the potential of clinical functional imaging for more confident progression from preclinical to clinical development stages has been recognized. Pharmacological functional MRI (fMRI), which refers specifically to applications of fMRI to questions in drug development, provides one set of these tools. With related structural MRI measures, relatively high resolution data concerning target, disease-relevant pathophysiology and effects of therapeutic interventions can be related to brain functional anatomy. In this chapter, current and potential applications of pharmacological fMRI for target validation, patient stratification and characterization of therapeutic molecule pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are reviewed. Challenges to better realizing the promise of pharmacological fMRI will be discussed. The review concludes that there is a strong rationale for greater use of pharmacological fMRI particularly for early phase studies, but also outlines the need for preclinical and early clinical development to be more seamlessly integrated, for greater harmonization of clinical imaging methodologies and for sharing of data to facilitate these goals. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016."

"Epilepsy is a devastating group of neurological disorders characterized by periodic and unpredictable seizure activity in the brain. There is a critical need for new drugs and approaches given than at least one-third of all epilepsy patients are not made free of seizures by existing medications and become ""medically refractory"". Much of epilepsy research has focused on neuronal therapeutic targets, but current antiepileptic drugs often cause severe cognitive, developmental, and behavioral side effects. Recent findings indicate a critical contribution of astrocytes, star-shaped glial cells in the brain, to neuronal and network excitability and seizure activity. Furthermore, many important cellular and molecular changes occur in astrocytes in epileptic tissue in both humans and animal models of epilepsy. The goal of Astrocytes and Epilepsy is to comprehensively review exciting findings linking changes in astrocytes to functional changes responsible for epilepsy for the first time in book format. These insights into astrocyte contribution to seizure susceptibility indicate that astrocytes may represent an important new therapeutic target in the control of epilepsy. Astrocytes and Epilepsy includes background explanatory text on astrocyte morphology and physiology, epilepsy models and syndromes, and evidence from both human tissue studies and animal models linking functional changes in astrocytes to epilepsy. Beautifully labelled diagrams are presented and relevant figures from the literature are reproduced to elucidate key findings and concepts in this rapidly emerging field. Astrocytes and Epilepsy is written for neuroscientists, epilepsy researchers, astrocyte investigators as well as neurologists and other specialists caring for patients with epilepsy. Presents the first comprehensive book to synthesize historical and recent research on astrocytes and epilepsy into one coherent volume.

"Lactulose has received much attention in recent years because of its therapeutic and health-promoting properties, being considered as one of the most valuable compounds derived from lactose. Lactulose has been used for decades as a medicine in the treatment of chronic constipation and hepatic encephalopathy, but its prebiotic condition has opened also a field for it in the functional food business. Lactulose is produced by chemical synthesis with alkaline catalysts. Being a poorly specific reaction, pure lactose is needed as raw material and complex downstream operations are required, waste disposal being also an issue. The synthesis of lactulose by enzyme catalysis appears as an interesting technological option to overcome the limitations inherent to chemical synthesis but to date no enzymatic process is competitive. Two enzyme strategies have been proposed considering ╬▓-galactosidase transgalactosylation of fructose with lactose and lactose epimerization with cellobiose 2-epimerase. The former has the drawback of producing lactulose galacto-oligosaccharide mixtures, so it is not an option if pure lactulose is the required product; the latter is a more attractive and straightforward strategy, but the enzyme is produced in a non-generally recognized as safe organism and apparently is not yet available commercially.

"Foods, beyond their nutritional value, are increasingly perceived in connection with disease prevention and physical and mental well-being. Functional foods are defined in basic terms as ""foods that may provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition."" An underlying premise is that functional foods are foods, not medicine. Although primarily a problem of developed societies, health problems associated with modern eating habits are having a profound impact on developing countries as well, where deleterious effects are likely to be more evident because of economic constraints. Functional foods and health eating habits are then responses to the global change in lifestyle. The market for functional foods has been steadily growing in the last decades, representing both an opportunity and a challenge to food producers willing to meet such demand and conquer consumer acceptance.

"As presented in ""Chapter 4, Enzymatic Production of Galacto-Oligosaccharides and Chapter 5, Enzymatic Production of Lactulose,"" galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose are the most significant health-promoting oligosaccharides derived from lactose. However, several other products derived from lactose by either chemical or enzymatic conversion are valuable assets having a variety of food and nonfood uses. This chapter provides information regarding production technologies, applications, and current status for lactosucrose, lactitol, lactobionic acid, tagatose, epilactose, and fructosyl-galacto-oligosaccharides. Most of them are candidate prebiotics, even though not fulfilling all requirements to be considered as such, and also provide functional properties to the food matrices containing them. Some are mostly related to nonfood uses. Lactitol and tagatose are valuable low-calorie, noncariogenic sweeteners acceptable for lactose intolerants and diabetic persons, and the market has been developed based on that. Most important applications for lactobionic acid are related to nonfood uses in organ preservation and cosmetics, while tagatose is also used as cryoprotectant in organ preservation. Epilactose and fructosyl-galacto-oligosaccharides are emerging lactose-derived oligosaccharides whose technological potential needs to be assessed. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOSs) are properly considered as a prebiotic based on scientific evidence about their physiological effects, having some unique properties among prebiotics that allow them to be used as supplement in formulas for infants where they mimic the physiological effect of human milk oligosaccharides, which are key components in breast milk. GOSs are produced by enzymatic transgalactosylation of lactose with ╬▓-galactosidases, so their production technology is tightly connected to the field of enzyme biocatalysis. The chapter thoroughly reviews all aspects of GOS production with whole cells and isolated enzymes, both free in solution and immobilized. Special attention is given to downstream processing of the raw GOS produced to cope with the quality standards imposed by their use as special food components. Cost of downstream operations is a major issue, so advances in GOS purification by different strategies are analyzed. Finally, current applications and perspectives of GOS within the prebiotic sector are reviewed and appraised. Competition with other well-established prebiotics (inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides) and potential prebiotic newcomers is envisaged, so the unique properties of lactose in terms of their physiological effect and functional properties are on the basis of GOS consolidation in an increasingly competitive market. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Epigenetics are DNA modifications that do not involve changes in the sequence of nucleotide bases, but affect the translation of the genetic code to the phenotype. Several epigenetic changes in the DNA are currently being investigated as cancer biomarkers. The aim is to summarize the diagnostic ability of the most promising epigenetic cancer biomarkers in terms of hypermethylated promoter DNA released into the circulation from solid malignant tumors. The diagnostic ability in terms of sensitivity and specificity at disease stages I-IV among patients with lung, gastric, liver, colorectal, and breast cancer is provided.

"It is increasingly realized that there is a critical need for understanding the process of cancer, especially the most malignant form of the cancer, its distant metastasis, in order for the development of the ultimate cure for this deadly disease. To date, metastatic forms of cancers remain the deadliest of all. As the war against cancer marches on, along comes the understanding of the complexity of the problem. Metastasis of cancer, the distant establishment of growth, is the result of a series of longitudinal and progressive developments that stems from the primary tumor site, flows through body circulation, affects multiple organs and tissues, and eventually establishes itself at the distant target site(s). The process, termed metastatic cascade, involves cross talks of primary tumor cells with the primary tissue microenvironment, surviving circulating cells with immune systems, and invading tumor cells with endothelial cells in the target tissue microenvironment. It is also our current understanding that a multitude of interactions among numerous signaling pathways, signaling molecules, and structural entities are involved in the process of metastasis. Gradually research is linking various phenotypes of metastasis to the fundamental mechanisms involved in epigenome modulations. This chapter focuses on summarizing the advancement in the research that illustrates epigenetic regulations in critical steps during metastasis that lead to the final stage of cancer progression, in an attempt to lead the field to potential solutions in cancer treatment and therapeutics that may be better approached by dealing with epigenetic mechanisms. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"The development of hormone-dependent cancers has an important epigenetic component. Breast and prostate cancers are two of the most prevalent hormone-dependent cancers and display important epigenetic alterations of DNA methylation and histone modifications. These alterations impact on their development, their progression, and their therapeutical response to endocrine therapy. Factors influencing the epigenetics of hormone-dependent cancers include genetic alterations, the metabolic status of the cancer cells, as well as environmental factors such as the diet, exposition to endocrine disruptors, and health states underlying endocrine dysfunctions inclusive of obesity and diabetes. By impacting on the metabolic state of the cancer cells, these environmental factors alter the epigenetic profiles inherent to hormone-dependent cancers. The impact of these factors and their interplay in modulating the epigenome of breast and prostate cancer is discussed in this chapter. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Disease manifestation results from the interaction of the genome with environment stimuli in a complex interplay that ultimately affects both the structure and function of the genome. Both genetic and epigenetic changes affect the genome and are equally important players in this process and ultimately affect the disease outcomes. The past decades have seen an exponential increase in our understanding of both genetic and epigenetic events in the normal and disease states with the advent of whole genome technologies. As the cost of these whole genome technologies has diminished, there is now emerging use of biomarkers including single gene as well as multigene sets or whole arrays to accurately predict the course or the outcome of a particular disease. This review summarizes the current knowledge on both genetic and epigenetic changes in genes associated with various diseases with a special focus on cancer.

"Much advancement has been made in the understanding of phenotype through regulation of the genome by epigenetic mechanisms. Advancing technologies have enabled epigenetic analysis in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. These findings have significant clinical potential. Epigenetic changes occur very early in the transition to disease state and therefore can be used as biomarkers for earlier diagnoses, risk stratification, and chemoprevention. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications have several therapeutic implications; they can be used to assess the effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention and they can be directly targeted with epigenomic modifying agents. Further research is needed to better understand how epigenomic modifications are regulated and how they interact with the environment, to characterize epigenetic profiles through disease progression, and to investigate epigenetic therapeutics.

"In the last decade, strong evidence has emerged on the link between diet and epigenetic mechanisms of diseases. Dietary bioactive molecules from vegetables, fruits, and some beverages have been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory, antioxidative, and anticancer activities through multiple mechanisms including epigenetic changes associated with DNA methylation, histone modifications, and modulation of microRNAs. The epigenetic molecular mechanisms that contribute to the chemopreventive nature of dietary polyphenols have been widely studied, particularly in cancer. In addition, immunosensitization and chemosensitization properties of dietary agents make them viable candidates for combinatorial strategies leading to synergistic beneficial effects. In this chapter, we summarize current knowledge on the most studied natural products, nutrients and food components and their effects on DNA methylation, histone modifications and miRNAs in different diseases.

"Epigenetic modifying drugs are currently being evaluated in numerous clinical trials to treat cancer and other diseases. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 2 DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitors-azacitidine and decitabine-to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and 3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors-vorinostat and romidepsin-to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and belinostat to treat peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Epigenetic modifications lead to reversible global changes that affect diverse cellular processes like proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, differentiation, and DNA-repair. Apart from their use as single agents in the clinic for specific cancers, preclinical studies show substantial benefits of combining several HDAC inhibitors and DNMT inhibitors with diverse treatment modalities, particularly in solid and hematological malignancies. Though epigenetic modifications are lately associated with several diseases, most of these combinatorial therapies are designed to treat cancer. Limited clinical trials use epigenetic drugs in combination therapies in other diseases. This chapter discusses the potential of combining epigenetic therapies with current treatment modalities.

"Personalized epigenetics identifies epigenetic alterations in individual patients as a predisposition for diseases or, if a disease is already present, their influence on disease progression and therapeutic outcome. This review gives a brief overview of different epigenetic layers that will impact personalized medicine, focused on DNA and histone modifications. Examples of how epigenetic drivers affect the course of diseases will be discussed with an emphasis on cancer; however, many of these concepts are applicable to other diseases. In contrast to genetic mutations, alterations in the epigenome are much more dynamic. Environmental influences or even aging constantly modify existing epigenetic traits. Furthermore, therapies produce a considerable selection pressure in epigenetic marks that can contribute to therapy resistance. The increasing knowledge of the dynamic epigenetic landscape along with the possibility to reverse epigenetic modifications makes this an attractive field for drug development. However, several examples show that the outcome of epigenetic interventions is context dependent. Therefore, new therapeutic principles have to carefully consider the interactions between epigenetic writers, readers, erasers, and chromatin modifying complexes. To keep pace with the huge technological advances and the rapidly increasing knowledge in biomedicine, new collaborations have to be implemented to include personalized epigenetics in clinical decision-making. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Infection with the Gram-negative pathogen Helicobacter pylori is the most prevalent chronic bacterial infection affecting about 50 % of the human world population and is the main risk factor for gastric cancer development. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1╬▓ plays a crucial role in the development of gastric tumors, and polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene cluster resulting in increased IL-1╬▓ production have been associated with increased risk for gastric cancer. Recently, Helicobacter pylori was postulated to activate the inflammasome in human and mouse immune cells, and the molecular mechanisms and the bacterial virulence factors activating the inflammasome were elucidated in cell culture as well as animal models. It appears that H. pylori-induced IL-1╬▓ secretion is mediated by activation of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), Nod-like receptor family member NLRP3 and caspase-1. The cag pathogenicity island-encoded type IV secretion system, lipopolysaccharide, vacuolating cytotoxin, and urease B subunit appear to play a role in inflammasome activation. In addition, recent results indicate that the TLR-2 ÔåÆ NLRP3 ÔåÆ caspase-1 ÔåÆ IL-18 axis is critical to H. pylori-specific immune regulation conferring protection against allergen-induced asthma and inflammatory bowel disease in murine models.

"Noncoding RNA are implicated in a wide array of human diseases including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, and metabolic. The modulation of noncoding RNA in diseased cells and tissues is considered a highly promising approach for the development of novel therapies. The efforts for the development of novel therapeutics that target noncoding RNA are so far the most advanced for microRNA, although long noncoding RNA are also increasingly recognised as promising therapeutic targets. We present here the various approaches for modulating noncoding RNA and discuss their respective benefits and shortcomings. We also consider candidate noncoding RNA targets for therapeutic manipulation and novel microRNA-based drugs that are currently involved in clinical trials. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Dysregulation of cellular epigenetic machinery is linked to the pathogenesis of a number of malignancies and has been studied extensively in the myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Alteration of DNA methylation in cancer cells results in transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, such as azacitidine and decitabine, have been used to reexpress these genes and have demonstrated therapeutic benefit in both benign and malignant diseases. In this chapter, we discuss the clinical application of demethylating agents, the data that has led to their approval in hematologic diseases, and future potential uses of these agents both alone and in combination. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, are universally known to contribute to the promotion of good health. However, the first indications of the molecular mechanisms through which these environmental changes impact cellular function have only recently been recognized. Burgeoning studies have proposed the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the molecular responses evoked by environmental changes and their potential to be considered as alternative tools in preventive medicine. Based on the modern concepts of epigenetic vulnerability, increasing evidence has supported the benefits of manipulating nutritional factors and physical exercise in modulating epigenetic patterns for promoting better health. Within this context, the present chapter assesses the current knowledge related to the fundamentals of epigenetic vulnerability to environmental changes and the effects of nutrition and physical exercise on the modulation of epigenetic patterns applied to preventive medicine. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Deacetylases are a class of enzymes which remove the ?-. N-acetyl groups from lysine amino acids in histone and nonhistone targets. There are four classes of HDACs, with a distinct subgroup called sirtuins (HDAC class III) that rely on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) for their catalytic activity. The fact that most of the sirtuins require NAD for their deacetylase activity, indicates that they are major energy-sensing proteins in cells and tissues with the potency to effect a plethora of biochemical, physiological, and pathological processes. These effects exerted by various sirtuins are discussed in this chapter, as well as the processes regulating NAD levels by de novo and salvage pathways. Finally, we elaborate on current agents targeting sirtuins and salvage pathway enzymes and their preclinical and clinical outcomes. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Epigenetic features are influenced by exogenous stimuli and constitute a link between physiological changes and genome modulation in a cell-specific manner. Because disruptions of epigenetic features are implicated in various complex traits, epigenetic mechanisms need to be integrated into toxicology, at least for two reasons. (1) The attraction of epigenetic therapy has created a boost in the development of newer (epigenetic) drugs with DNA and chromatin modifying capabilities to revert epigenetic imbalances in complex human diseases. (2) Conversely, the exposure of humans to external stimuli, also including therapeutics and environmental factors can trigger unwanted epigenetic modulation. This chapter reviews the important role of epigenetics in toxicology, and provides information on several relevant aspects: (1) disease-associated epigenetic aberrations in cellular and molecular depth as potential adverse effects as well as therapeutic targets, (2) critical safety insight on environmental hazards, (3) the current knowledge gaps in the medical field, (4) epigenetic drugs in practice and in development, and (5) viable solutions for the exploration of novel endpoints and the integration of screening tools toward prediction of adverse epigenetic modulation in human safety assessment. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have emerged as potential cancer therapeutic agents, and several classes of them have exhibited good anticancer activity with a favorable toxicity profile in hematologic malignancies. In addition, HDAC inhibitors have shown promise in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Furthermore, they are emerging as promising antifibrotic, antiinflammatory, and antidiabetic agents.Because aberrant activity and expression of HDACs are implicated in the development of a wide range of human diseases, various HDAC inhibitors are being investigated for their therapeutic potential. Furthermore, due to the demonstrable activity and favorable toxicity profile, some of the HDAC inhibitors have received approval from the US FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma as well as cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other drugs.Although preclinical trials show that HDAC inhibitors have a variety of biological effects across multiple pathways, the mechanism by which the clinical activity is mediated remains unclear. Understanding mechanisms of action of HDAC inhibitors is necessary not only for finding of predictive biomarkers in disease initiation and progression, but for the design of optimized clinical protocols.This chapter describes the effects of HDAC inhibitors on cancer, schizophrenia, diabetes, and fibrotic and inflammatory diseases based on the findings from both preclinical studies and clinical trials. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"It was hoped that the Human Genome Project would launch a new era for medicine, providing new insights into the mechanism, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous diseases. However, even as it was being completed, scientists were realizing that there was a layer of epigenetic code not explained by Mendelian inheritance, but which helped control our subtly balanced life support system. To date, knowledge about epigenetics in biological processes is rapidly increasing due to the discovery of new epigenetic code and the development of new techniques for epigenome profiling. For example, new epigenetic alterations related to normal development and disease pathogenesis are continuously discovered. These variants are involved in DNA methylation, histone modification, histone variation, and control of noncoding RNAs. Owing to these discoveries, the US Food and Drug Administration have approved at least seven epigenetic drugs and more agents are on the way. Furthermore, mounting reference epigenomes from healthy and diseased human cells are being mapped under the concerted effort of the International Human Epigenome Consortium, which promises to be a great resource for disease diagnostics, prognostics, and clinical therapeutics. Eventually, with the personalized epigenetic information, the precision medicine will help deliver the right treatment to the individual patient at the right time, which is the ultimate goal of future medical epigenetics. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Epigenetics has been recognized as a promising area for oncology target discovery because epigenetic regulatory processes are frequently dysregulated in cancer. Histone methylation constitutes an epigenetic regulatory pathway that allows for the effective regulation of gene expression. Histone methylation modifiers such as lysine methyltransferases and demethylases, protein arginine methyltransferases, and arginine deiminases function as coactivators and corepressors to maintain a cell's transcriptional program that defines its identity. In cancer cells, perturbation of this histone methylation network through gain of function mutations in individual histone methylation modifiers or through alterations in chromatin regulatory pathways that create functional dependencies on individual histone methylation modifiers alter cell fate and promote uncontrolled proliferation. The realization that cancer cells may depend on altered epigenetic regulatory cues that may be exploited therapeutically has propelled recent drug discovery initiatives. Potent and selective inhibitors of the histone methyltransferases EZH2 and DOT1L and the histone demethylase KDM1A have shown promise in preclinical oncology studies and have progressed to clinical development. In addition, a plethora of small molecules targeting other histones methylation modifiers is now available to explore disease biology. This chapter provides an overview of histone methylation modifiers and highlights key oncology targets in this space. The focus is set on medical therapeutics, and thus on the discovery of inhibitors of histone methylation modifiers and their potential value for the treatment of cancer. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Pharmacoepigenomics deals with the influence that epigenetic alterations (DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, non-coding RNA dysregulation) exert on drug efficacy and safety, and also on the effects that drugs may have on the epigenetic machinery. Genes involved in pharmacogenomics (pathogenic, mechanistic, metabolic, transporter, pleiotropic genes) are also affected by epigenetic modifications conditioning the therapeutic outcome. A series of epigenetic drugs have been developed, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (nucleoside analogs, small molecules, bioproducts, antisense oligonucleotides, miRNAs), histone deacetylase inhibitors (short-chain fatty acids, hydroxamic acids, cyclic peptides, benzamides, ketones, sirtuin inhibitors, sirtuin activators), histone acetyltransferase modulators, histone methyltransferase inhibitors, histone demethylase inhibitors, non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) with potential effects against myelodysplastic syndromes, different types of cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. These drugs may modify epigenetic functions under normal and pathological conditions. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacoepigenetic studies should be incorporated as routine procedures in the future for the proper evaluation of efficacy and safety issues in drug development and clinical trials. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder, characterized by malignant proliferation of immature abnormal myeloid precursors. Both cytogenetic and molecular genetic mutations are recognized to have an impact on prognosis of AML. Recently, several recurrent mutations in epigenetic machinery have been linked to abnormal gene expression as a leading cause in initiation and progression of AML. These alterations include key proteins involved in DNA methylation, posttranslational histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and microRNAs. Unlike genetic events, epigenetic effects may be targeted and reversed pharmacologically, resulting in the potential change of a specific epigenetic state. The promising results of combination clinical trials with DNA methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors have highlighted their potential use in AML therapy. However, the precise function of the epigenetic framework in AML pathogenesis and the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of epigenetic compounds have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we illustrate the key players in epigenetic networks, and their aberrant role in AML. In addition, we examine epigenetic therapies currently under investigation that have shown promise in treating AML. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"This chapter comprises the most recent developments with respect to the role of human histone acetyltransferases (HATs) in diseases and the potential therapeutic applications of HAT inhibitors. HATs form a diverse group of mainly nuclear enzymes that play an important role in the acetylation of lysine residues of histone- and nonhistone proteins. Acetylations of histone lysine residues are part of the histone code and contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Acetylation of nonhistone proteins such as transcription factors, nuclear receptors, and other enzymes, influences activity of these targets and links HAT activity to many different signal transduction cascades. Apart from their enzymatic activity HATs have also been described to play a role in protein-protein interactions in protein complexes. These diverse protein complexes determine substrate specificity and expand the range of targets.Both the enzymatic activity and the structural role of HATs have been associated with several different diseases like cancer, inflammatory diseases, viral infections, and neuronal disorders. Although the development of therapeutics targeting HATs is still in a very early stage, significant efforts have been made to develop small molecule inhibitors of HAT activity. Inhibitors have been developed that are selective between HAT families. However, selectivity seems difficult to achieve due to the conserved acetyl coenzyme A binding site among the respective HAT families. An alternative strategy is development of allosteric inhibitors, because they have the potential to be selective between subtypes of the same family. HATs interact with many proteins, modulating their activity where sometimes acetylation activity is not even required, for example, through bromodomains or other protein interaction domains. Inhibition of these protein-protein interactions is a promising way of targeting specific HAT pathways.Knowledge about HATs, HAT subtypes, and the correlation with histone- and nonhistone acetyltransferase is too fragmented to predict the effect of HAT inhibitors in disease state as yet. However, the current research on HAT inhibitors shows promising results for these important epigenetic enzymes to become drug targets for therapeutics against disease. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"The primary mechanisms of epigenetics consisting of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA have a major impact on medical processes ranging from epidemiological aspects of medicine to medical therapy. It is now apparent that many medical disorders have a component of epigenetics that contributes to their pathology and epigenetic mechanisms can influence many different aspects of medical management such as diagnosis, disease progression, and prognosis of medical disorders. The pulmonary, immune, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrine, and reproductive systems as well as many others can be affected by epigenetic aberrations that lead to disease manifestations. Multisystem disorders such as those relevant to pediatrics, infections, and metastasis as well as numerous others are also very important with respect to the expression of epigenetic diseases. Perhaps most exciting has been the development of epigenetic approaches to medical therapy, and this once very small field has now expanded to new DNA methylation, histone deacetylase, and histone acetylase inhibitors as well as development of epigenetic-based RNA molecules for therapy. These approaches are being developed for applications such as combinatorial therapy, the management of pain, personalized medicine, and may have future roles in stem cell as well as regenerative medicine. The field of clinical epigenetics has significantly expanded within a relatively short period of time, which is most likely due to the importance that this discipline has to healthcare in general. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Complex interactions between genes and the environment drive the development of chronic intestinal diseases. In particular, the microbiota in the intestinal environment appears to significantly impact intestinal heath and susceptibility to disease. New research has begun to examine mechanisms underlying how signals derived from the microbiota are integrated by mammalian cells. Epigenomic mechanisms enable changes in gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. Consistent with this theory of epigenomic regulation, recent work has suggested that epigenomic modifications and the enzymes that maintain DNA and histone modifications integrate local microbial signals to regulate intestinal homeostasis. Here, we will cover links between epigenomics and intestinal development and homeostasis, the microbiota, immune regulation in the intestine, chronic intestinal diseases, and therapeutic approaches. Future studies will continue to move toward a more complete picture of how genetic, diet-derived, and microbial cues are integrated by the epigenome in the development and progression of intestinal disease. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"DNA methylation is a stable yet reversible epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression. New technologies have provided deep insights into the distribution and function of DNA methylation in humans, including the Human Roadmap Epigenome Project that defined genomewide methylation profiles across tissues and developmental stages, with the data available to anyone with Internet access. Exciting recent discoveries have revealed that 5-methylcytosine can be modified by ten-eleven translocase dioxygenases (TET1, 2, and 3) to form 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). 5hmC is enriched in brain tissues and in embryonic stem cells and appears to have a regulatory role distinct from that of 5-methylcytosine (5mC). 5hmC also acts as a substrate for further modifications by the TET enzymes (5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine) which undergo base excision repair by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) with replacement by unmethylated cytosine. These revelations present new challenges, including the need for technologies to quantify these modifications, determine their role in pathologies, and ways to target these modified bases and involved pathways to improve patient outcomes. Strategies to reverse abnormal hypermethylation of 5mC at specific loci are being developed and will eventually improve on the generalized toxicity associated with current DNA methyltransferase inhibitor therapies. Finally, exposures to endogenous and exogenous agents can lead to changes in methylation levels that increase disease risk. The sum combinatorial changes comprise what we refer to as each individual's unique ""epigenoprint"" that may be useful for determining risk of disease, best strategies for prevention and individualized interventions, likelihood of positive therapeutic response, and lead to improved prognoses. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Infectious diseases are a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide, and are caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. The interactions between pathogen and host require rapid adaptation and evolution to avoid death, from the perspective of both the host and the pathogen. Epigenetic processes in both the host and pathogen are key to the outcome of these interactions. This chapter provides an overview and examples of host epigenetic responses to pathogens via histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin-associated complexes, and noncoding RNAs. Survival of pathogens in the human host depends on appropriate adaptation to distinct microenvironments within the host and to differences between individual hosts. In both cases, the invading pathogen is challenged by the dynamic processes of the host's innate and adaptive immune responses. In recent years, the importance of the role of epigenetic regulation in pathogens has been appreciated and will be reviewed in this chapter, with a particular focus on the epigenetics of human bacterial pathogens. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Different types of exercise and physical activities induce mechanical, hormonal, and metabolic stimuli, leading to adaptions of almost every tissue and cell-type. Recent research has shown that both acute and chronic exercise are potential epigenetic modifiers (affecting DNA methylation, posttranslational histone modifications, and the expression of micro RNAs), changing the functional genome in gametes, muscle-, blood-, and fat-cells in brain tissue as well as in cells of the cardiovascular system. The results of these studies reveal that exercise-induced epigenetic modifications may counteract pathophysiological alterations of the epigenome, for example, in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. It is hypothesized that positive preventative and rehabilitative effects of exercise are at least partly driven by epigenetic modifications, which for instance contribute to a reduced systemic inflammation and local adaptions, such as a demethylation of tumor-suppressor genes. Furthermore, first data shows that responders to specific exercise programs (eg, resistance training) express another epigenetic pattern compared to nonresponders. Additionally, different types and intensities of exercise exhibit specific epigenetic responses, which can be directly measured in muscle tissue but also in the circulation. Therefore, epigenetic adaptions may be used as markers for exercise conducting and controlling in the future. However, more research is needed to receive more profound and meaningful knowledge about exercise-induced epigenetic modifications in particular tissues and their consequences. Since exercise seems to provoke different responses throughout the life-span and the speculation that exercise can rewind the epigenetic ""clock,"" age should always be considered as a covariate in further studies. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Skin disorders are a large family of various complex diseases and dysfunctions. With the development of epigenetics in human diseases, more and more skin disorders were proved to be associated with epigenetic modifications. Defined as heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve a change in the genomic DNA sequence, epigenetics may play a significant role and open a new window in skin disorders.In this chapter, we summarize the epigenetic modifications of a number of skin disorders including immunologic skin diseases, infectious skin diseases, skin tumors, and skin aging. We also review a number of candidate epigenetic markers and potential therapeutic strategies. Understanding the concepts of epigenetics can provide insights into the pathogenesis of skin disorders, and may lead to the development of biomarkers, improve prognosis, and support the development of novel molecular targets in therapies, especially refractory skin diseases. Epigenetics will serve as the next large area of medicine with the potential to treat and possibly prevent skin diseases in the future. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"The majority of our genome is pervasively transcribed, but not translated into proteins. These highly heterogeneous noncoding transcripts proved to have key cellular functions. One of the major features described for noncoding RNAs is their ability to create tridimensional structures that serve as scaffold, guide, or decoy for proteins and other transcripts. Recent data support the notion of a prominent role of these interactions in the epigenetic modulation of gene expression mediated by chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers that act converging environmental signals to DNA. These epigenetic marks have the peculiarity to be maintained throughout generations, even when the cue is no longer present without altering DNA sequence. Given the key importance of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cell physiology, therapeutic approaches based on ncRNAs targeting via diverse tools are now under development and offer many advantages over classical protein-targeting therapies. Understanding the basis of ncRNAs' interaction with the epigenetic machinery is therefore of key interest in order to expand our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms driving epigenetic modifications and to guide the development of novel and more specific therapeutic approaches. Noncoding transcripts not only act within the cell in which they are transcribed but also can be actively or passively released to body fluids where pathological alterations in the expression of noncoding genes can be detected. These pathology-related signatures can be easily exploited as biomarkers for disease onset and progression. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"In concert with genetic mechanisms, epigenetic modifications finely regulate gene expression in physiological conditions, during cellular development, and in response to external stimuli. In disease conditions, the epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are often deregulated. Cardiac muscle remodeling, skeletal muscle metabolism, and smooth muscle cell plasticity are largely influenced by epigenetic changes. How epigenetics regulates these processes in muscle tissues will be reviewed in this chapter with a focus on the mechanisms of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and regulation by noncoding RNAs. Strong associations between changes in epigenetics and disease progression have been described in many muscular disorders, thus rendering drugs that affect epigenetics, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and microRNA-targeting drugs, efficient tools for the treatment of patients. Among the muscular diseases, this chapter will discuss motor neuron degeneration diseases, rhabdomyosarcoma, and muscular dystrophies. How epigenetics influences these pathologies and the potential usefulness of epigenetic drugs for the treatment of these diseases will also be discussed in this chapter. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"A growing body of evidence suggests that the risk of development and progression of a variety of human chronic diseases depends on epigenetic modifications triggered by environmental cues during early life sensitive stages and, to a lesser extent, throughout adulthood. Environmental factors such as exposure to adverse nutritional, psychological, and social conditions, as well as to environmental pollutants, substances of abuse, and infections have been shown to be important determinants of epigenetic programing of chronic pathological conditions in modern human populations. Over the past years, it has become increasingly clear owing to the epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), that early environmental insults can induce long-lasting widespread epigenetic dysregulation. Several candidate genes have been identified underlying these associations. In this context, DNA methylation is the most intensively studied epigenetic phenomenon. In the present chapter, recent epidemiological studies are reviewed, suggesting the role of epigenetic factors in mediating the relationship between life-course environmental exposures and long-term health outcomes. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Many eye diseases have complex etiologies. Though numerous risk alleles and biological pathways have been implicated in the development of such diseases, they cannot be fully explained by known genetic factors. It is now known that epigenetic factors contribute to the development and progression of many eye diseases. These epigenetic modifications are dynamic, work via diverse mechanisms, and some components of our epigenome can be affected by the environments we have been exposed to during our lifetime. Epigenetic modifications can be used medically as biomarkers for predicting disease status or progression, and some may be potential targets for future therapeutic strategies. The epigenetic mechanisms implicated in ocular disease include DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA regulation. In this chapter we will describe how epigenetic modifiers affect key elements of ocular disease, such as cell proliferation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and inflammation. We have grouped ocular diseases into three general areas for discussion: proliferative (including cancer), complex, and age-related disease.

"Poverty, conflict, chemical contaminants, and substance abuse are examples of environmental conditions that are associated with malnutrition, stress, vulnerability to obesity, cancer, psychiatric and other diseases, and diminished life expectancy. We have come to expect that conditions such as these result in deleterious consequences for target populations. However, what if the effects of these conditions transcend generations? What if grandparents' adverse life experiences influence health and disease susceptibility of their grandchildren or even great-grandchildren? What are the implications for the practice of medicine and social justice? Evidence from human and animal studies in the rapidly growing field of transgenerational epigenetics suggests that the inherited consequences of adverse ancestral life experiences are real. Biology can be programmed in one generation to produce long-lasting, multigenerational maladaptation. Periods of embryonic development and epigenetic programing, which modify the output of genes, are specifically vulnerable to environmental perturbations. This chapter discusses the somewhat checkered history of enquiry into the heritability of acquired traits, along with more recent experimental and epidemiological data that validates the phenomenon of transgenerational epigenetics. Last, we focus on specific examples of environmental perturbations, diet, exposure to toxic chemicals, and addiction that can be modeled in the laboratory, to show how transgenerational epigenetic mechanisms may underlie human susceptibility to disease. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Throughout organism development and during normal tissue homeostasis, progenitor cells undergo dramatic changes in gene expression to adapt to new functions. Such reprogramming is strongly dependent on epigenetic mechanisms. As these processes are, at least partially, recapitulated after tissue damage, they are attractive targets for the stimulation of tissue regeneration.Mammalian tissues vary in their regenerative capabilities. Some tissues, such as the liver or skeletal muscle possess the capacity to support complete regeneration, reacquiring tissue function. On the other hand, organs such as the brain or epidermis usually undergo processes of repair, resolving tissue damage through the formation of nonfunctional tissue, which is referred to as a scar. Regenerative medicine aims at facilitating the restoration of the function of damaged tissues. It exploits various techniques towards this goal-that is, gene therapy and cell replacement. A further tool of regenerative medicine is the use of drugs that target key players in epigenetic processes, with the ultimate goal of exploiting the common epigenetic properties of development and tissue homeostasis to facilitate regeneration.In this chapter, we cover the central nervous system (CNS) and skeletal muscle due to these tissues being on opposite sides of the aforementioned spectrum of regenerative capabilities. We introduce tissue homeostatic properties of both systems, putting emphasis on epigenetic processes. For the two tissues, we also discuss commonly encountered types of damage. Finally, we explore strategies to overcome tissue damage through targeting of the epigenetic machinery, emphasizing the differences and similarities between these two distinct tissues. We conclude the chapter with a concise discussion of how the epigenetic consequences of aging influence tissue homeostasis and regeneration. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Monozygotic twins are essentially genetic copies. Greater phenotypic concordance between monozygotic twin pairs compared to dizygotic pairs is taken as evidence of an underlying genetic contribution.

Twin studies have formed a major foundation for the dissection of complex traits and multifactorial disease in humans. Here, I discuss recent studies using discordant monozygotic twin pairs that suggest a role for epigenetics in simple and complex disorders and in aging. I also highlight caveats in interpretations of the data and some future directions in the field. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Pulmonary diseases are one of the leading causes of death in the world. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), lung tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism, as well as other disorders, are significant public health burdens. Although advances in methods of detection, intervention, and treatment have prolonged life for patients, these complex illnesses continue to have serious effects on a large segment of the global population. Epigenetics is defined as the study of heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms that do not alter the nucleotide sequence. There are three main classes of epigenetic marks: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs. DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5 position of cytosine by DNA methyltransferases and can be inherited through cell division. Histone modifications are posttranslational processes such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination of the tails of core histones, each of which plays different roles in gene expression. MicroRNAs are approximately 22 nucleotide-long regulatory RNAs that control gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to mRNA degradation or inhibition of protein translation. Increasingly, the evidence suggests that these three important epigenetic mechanisms play significant roles in the pathogenetic processes of lung diseases. Understanding these mechanisms may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this chapter the influence of epigenetic variations on the pathophysiology of COPD, asthma, interstitial lung diseases, PAH, lung tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism is described. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Compared to genomics or transcriptomics, proteomics is often regarded as an ÔÇ£emerging technology,ÔÇØ i.e., as not having reached the same level of maturity. While the successful implementation of proteomics workflows and technology still requires significant levels of expertise and specialization, great strides have been made to make the technology more powerful, streamlined and accessible.

"Although currently available therapeutics provide moderate relief from acute pain, therapeutic agents used for treating chronic pain are typically limited by adverse side effects, including tolerance, addiction, and constipation. Thus, there is a significant medical need for novel therapies devoid of serious adverse effects for the treatment of chronic pain. Histone deacetylase inhibitors and other epigenetic drugs, such as histone acetlytransferases inhibitors, have been shown to have a role in managing pain perception. This chapter will briefly review spinal and central pain pathways mediating nociception. We will discuss the animal models, which have enhanced our understanding of how epigenetic processes may play a role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic pain. We will also review the basic molecular epigenetic mechanisms of pain processing, and throughout the chapter the authors have attempted to critically evaluate the latest research from both experimental animal models and human studies to highlight the role of epigenetic drugs in managing both acute and chronic pain. However, it is pertinent to note that the role of epigenetics in pain perception is a field in its infancy, and thus limited data is to hand of the exact molecular mechanisms that mediate pain perception. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Differentiation of the male and female gametes involves extremely well-regulated epigenetic and chromatin changes. An appropriate complement of the imprinted genes in the male and female gametes is essential to allow appropriate epigenetic regulation and development of the embryo. Therefore any perturbations of imprinting during the reproductive process have the potential to result in male or female infertility and/or subsequent anomalies. Epidemiological data in the human population and studies in animal models suggest that environmental exposures and diet may result in epigenetic changes, which may be linked to common multifactorial disorders and infertility. An abnormal pattern of sperm DNA methylation, sperm RNA content, and sperm chromatin gene poising has been reported in some infertile men. Also altered epigenetics is being detected in female reproductive anomalies such as polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, and placental syndromes. Fortunately, reproductive dysfunction can be efficiently treated using assisted reproduction techniques. However, there are currently some concerns about whether the potential epigenetic immaturity of the gametes and the in vitro conditions used might result in epigenetic anomalies. While the vast majority of assisted reproduction children seem to be healthy, a slightly higher incidence of infants born with minor or major phenotypic or metabolic disturbances, or with known epigenetic syndromes such as Beckwith-Widemann, is under study. This chapter reviews the physiological epigenetic changes during reproduction and development, describes the main alterations associated with infertility or offspring defects potentially linked to epigenetics, and outlines the research frontiers currently being explored. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Complex neurodegenerative diseases such as sporadic Alzheimer disease are caused by variable combinations of genetic and environmental risk factors. Epigenetic processes control gene expression at the systems level and allow the cell to maintain homeostasis by transforming relevant stimuli into long-term adaptive changes. The emerging field of neuroepigenetics aims to understand the epigenetic underpinnings of learning and memory processes. Most importantly, deregulation of the epigenome within brain cells has been associated with various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, and the corresponding enzymatic machinery has been suggested as novel drug targets to treat, for example, dementia. In this chapter, we focus on the role of histone acetylation in neurodegenerative diseases and ask the question why these proteins could be suitable therapeutic targets. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Our understanding of epigenetics in complex diseases is rapidly advancing and increasingly influencing the practice of medicine. Much is known about disruption of chromatin-modifying enzymes in malignant disease, but knowledge of irregular epigenetics in immune-driven disorders is just emerging. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA or histone modifications, are indispensable for precise gene expression in diverse immune cell types. Thus a disruption of epigenetic landscapes likely has a large impact on immune homeostasis. Moreover, the low concordance rates for most autoimmune diseases suggest that epigenetics contribute to immune tolerance disturbance. Here we review the important role of epigenetics for initiation, maintenance, tolerance, and training of immune responses. We discuss evolving evidence that DNA/histone modifications and chromatin-modifying enzymes are altered in immune-based diseases. Furthermore, we explore the potential of small molecules targeting epigenetic machinery, some of which are already used in oncology, as a way to reset the immune response in disease. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Epigenetics plays a role in many disorders that are present in the pediatric populations (eg, in early human development, including-embryologic and fetal life, infancy, childhood, and adolescence). Many syndromes were described because of their characteristic clinical features before epigenetic mechanisms were understood. Because time in development (age), as well as tissue specific and gender specific gene expression are so important in early development, it is not surprising that disturbances in control of gene expression will lead to pathologic conditions. These groups of disorders are important in pediatrics, and, thus, to the pediatrician.Mammalian flexibility in response to environmental change is now recognized to play a role in transgenerational programming for many chronic diseases of adults that appear to have their genesis in very early life. Working out the pathways and mechanisms for these disorders holds the promise for therapy in the future. Small for dates (IUGR) newborns should avoid excess weight gain during infancy and early childhood as this may help prevent some chronic diseases. Recording data on the placenta at birth is likely to be important for future research and possibly therapy. A new type of family history including multigenerational information on birth weights, environmental exposures, pregnancy histories, and exposure to various types of stress will be important for future medical care. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Quantifying landscape connectivity and structural connectivity and relating both to measures of genetic variation is central in landscape genetics. Data from radio-telemetry and genetic analysis provide complementary pictures of the connectivity between populations and can in some cases give opposing results. This chapter focuses on landscape genetic study includes mountain nyala from five localities within the Bale Mountains that comprise about 86% of the total mountain nyala population of the area. In addition one locality in the Arussi Mountains is sampled. The chapter determines the structural connectivity between the different mountain nyala populations across the Bale Mountains by developing habitat-suitability maps using a resource selection function based on generalized linear models. It measures genetic variability and gene flow within and among the main subpopulations of the species and suggested potential corridors that may preserve dispersal of individuals. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"Algae produce a variety of valuable natural metabolites that may be used within the field of pharmaceuticals. Nowadays, different bioactive compounds such as fucoxanthin, fucophlorethol, loliolide, and deschloroelatol are isolated from algal species such as Myagropsis myagroides, Ascophyllum nodosum, Laurencia rigida, and Undaria pinnatifida. Parsiguine and tjipanazoles are other bioactive compounds with antimicrobial activity that are isolated from algal species like Tolypothrix tjipanasensis. In some cases, these isolated antibacterials can be used against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Eicosapentaenoic acid isolated from Phaeodactylum tricornutum is an example of a substance that can be deployed against MDR Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This chapter describes a number of successful studies and the current situation and perspectives on using algal species to produce bioactive molecules and antimicrobials. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has significantly increased in recent years. It is necessary to develop new strategies to combat resistant bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key endogenous molecule that is involved in several biological processes. Activated macrophages synthesize NO, which plays a key role in host defenses against microbes, including pathogenic bacteria. NO has been shown to be an attractive and potent antibiotic against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative resistant bacteria. NO has been shown to prevent and disperse bacterial biofilms. In view of this knowledge, this chapter presents NO as a potent antimicrobial agent by highlighting recent progress in the use of NO donors, NO prodrugs, and NO-releasing nanomaterials against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and biofilms. The multiple mechanisms of NO pathways that prevent bacteria from developing resistance are discussed. We hope to inspire new research in this promising area. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"The impending postantibiotic era creates an urgent requirement for alternative treatments of infectious diseases in humans and animals. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and kill bacteria. The application of bacteriophages as a treatment option was investigated before the development of antibiotics. However, the initial success of antibiotic therapy soon shifted the focus from bacteriophage research. The revitalization of phage therapy has received increased global attention since the appearance of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Bacteriophages replicate via either the lytic or lysogenic cycle. While both life cycles have potential applications in bacteriophage therapy, the lytic cycle seems most suited to antibacterial therapy. The most striking advantage of bacteriophage therapy is the high degree of host specificity exhibited by these viruses, which enables the formulation of tailored treatments that kill only pathogenic bacteria. However, the high specificity of such treatments requires highly accurate diagnostic procedures in order to succeed. Other restrictions of bacteriophage therapy, such as limitations with the registration of phage therapy options, may possibly be overcome by the expression and engineering of phage lytic enzymes, which break the bacterial cell wall. The problem of bacterial immunity to phage infection also cannot be ignored, although it is more solvable than resistance to antibiotics. Considering the available information, phage therapy holds promise as an alternative treatment option, although the road ahead is not without obstacles. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Development of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) and demand by consumers of fresher foods with no chemical preservatives added, and minimally processed with long shelf life, have increased demand for new antibacterial compounds, which has stimulated the identification, development, and redesign of antibiotics. For this reason, different antibacterial agents, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and bacteriocins are now being reevaluated. The latter compounds are peptides produced by different bacteria, which may act against a wide range of pathogens. Some of them are closely related to spoilage and disease-causing Gram-positive bacteria. In this chapter, we reviewed the use of bacteriocins for the control of MDRB. Bacteriocins have different applications in the food industry, especially for biopreservation and shelf-life extension, also as clinical antimicrobials and as microbial control during fermentation. There are different types of bacteriocins successfully applied in the food industry, such as nisin and pedicin PA-1/AcH, which have been authorized to be used as bio-preservatives. But they are only a small fraction of the diversity of these bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are a good option to use against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens in clinical cases because these AMPs may act at picomolar and nanomolar concentrations and with high specificity. Continuous research will lead to obtaining more diverse and efficient antimicrobial bacteriocins; in this case, recent development of new techniques for identification, purification, and heterologous proteins will allow for new antibiotics that can control MDRB. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Essential oils (EOs), which are complex blends of biologically active substances, are classified as natural products with pharmacological potential that can be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment and management of human diseases. EOs extracted from medicinal herbs and food plants are gaining a great deal of interest for their multifarious properties. The increased awareness in alternative natural substances is driving the research community to find new avenues for natural pharmacological agents. In this quest, EOs have been highlighted as natural substances having a rich source of compounds with antimicrobial and antibiotic potentiating properties. With the outbreak of antimicrobial resistance worldwide, EOs and their components have proved to provide useful template molecules for the development of alternative antimicrobial drugs. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the methods of extraction of EOs, their proficiency as antimicrobials, their mode of actions, and their efficacy in potentiating conventional antibiotics to counteract the action of resistant pathogens. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Nowadays, antibiotic resistance remains a crucial matter in fighting microbial infections. Thus, the screening for novel antimicrobial compounds mainly encompasses the exploration of natural resources, including marine products. Recent data highlighted the impact of marine-derived bacteria, fungi, algae, sponges, and other invertebrates (eg, corals, dinoflagellates, mollusks, gastropods, and tubeworms) for the production of novel antibiotics. Actinomycetes secondary metabolites, cyanobacterial alkaloids and nonribosomal peptides, exopolysaccharides, glycolipids, lipopeptides, bromopyrrole, chloropyrrole, and bromophenyl derivatives are the leading antimicrobial active ingredients from marine bacteria. Marine fungi also biosynthesize antimicrobial compounds, such as cephalosporins, anthraquinones, polyketides, alkaloids, peptides, diterpenoids, steroids, and glicosphingolipids. Fatty acids, bromophenol derivatives, sesquiterpenoid quinones, diterpenoids, and cyclic depsipeptides are antibacterial and antifungal substances isolated from marine algae. Concerning broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds, sponges are characterized by the highest chemical diversity of all marine natural products, in terms of fatty acids, brominated phenols, sesquiterpenoid quinones, diterpenoids, sesterterpenoids, macrolides, sulfated sterols, meroterpenoids, bromopyrrole alkaloids, steroidal alkaloids, lipopeptides, and cyclodepsipeptides. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Although multiple approaches have emerged for reducing the microbial resistance and morbidity and mortality associated with persistent infections, current statistics reveal their poor efficiency. In this context, recent nanotechnological progress offers a new perspective in infection control, supported by highly specialized and efficient nanomaterials that can control the delivery, release, and efficiency of antimicrobial drugs in particular infections, thus reducing side effects and probably resistance rates. This chapter presents and discusses the current microbial resistance situation, which affects the entire world population and the perspective imposed by magnetite-based nanomaterials in developing alternative therapeutic and preventive antipathogenic approaches. Antimicrobial-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles, polymeric magnetite-based biomaterials, and enzyme-immobilization procedures in magnetic nanosystems with a great impact on antiinfectious therapies are also highlighted. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Despite a longstanding understanding that many endogenous and exogenous agents can damage DNA, knowledge of how DNA repairs itself was largely an academic pursuit until the last two decades. The ongoing molecular characterization of the DNA damage response (DDR) and pathway crosstalk is invaluable in helping scientists learn how to modulate DNA repair activities therapeutically-ultimately translating discoveries into standalone or combination treatments, chemosensitizers or radiosensitizers. The study of DNA repair is also uncovering synthetic lethalities that are induced when an inhibitor capitalizes on a tumor-specific dysfunction or mutation. Although these targeted anticancer treatments are designed to cause less toxicity to normal cells, we still have much to learn before we can fully and optimally exploit this type of intervention. This chapter summarizes the history of DNA repair, explains important ""firsts"" in the field of DNA repair inhibition, overviews all DNA repair pathways, and suggests future directions for DNA repair inhibition. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"DNA-interacting chemotherapy agents such as platinums and bifunctional alkylating agents represent major drugs for the management of advanced cancers, either given alone or in combination with other cytotoxic or targeted agents. The clinical outcome using these agents, however, is unpredictable and often patients experience high rates of recurrence. In particular, development of acquired resistance to these agents represents the hallmark in clinical settings. In many instances resistant cells overcome chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and replication collapse via upregulation of DNA repair and associated cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms; these represent the core of the DNA damage response. Proteins involved in these pathways are regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms and many have protein kinase components modulated by DNA damage-activated mitogen activated kinase (MAPK) cascades. This chapter addresses the role of MAPK signaling in chemotherapy-induced DNA damage response and its relationship to drug resistance, as well as the impact of recently identified mutations in MAPK genes than can either positively or negatively impact on the DNA damage response. The therapeutic potential and limitations of MAPK inhibitors and the necessity of molecular endpoints to identify individuals that can benefit from a therapeutic response which combines cytotoxic chemotherapy with MAPK modulators are discussed. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a suicide enzyme that repairs the cytotoxic DNA adducts O6-methylguanine and O6-chloroethylguanine induced by methylating (procarbazine, dacarbazine, streptozotocine, temozolomide) and chloroethylating (lomustine, nimustine, carmustine, fotemustine) anticancer drugs, respectively. MGMT represents an important factor in the resistance of tumors treated with these alkylating agents. Since O6-alkylguanine is not only a toxic DNA lesion but also one that initiates tumorigenesis, MGMT is at the same time a key node in the defense against cancer formation. Here we describe how MGMT protects against the activation of cell death pathways triggered by O6-alkylguanine, the methods employed for detecting MGMT and summarize data concerning the regulation of MGMT, its expression in normal and malignant cells, and its validation as a predictive/prognostic factor in cancer therapy. Furthermore, we discuss strategies for targeting MGMT using MGMT inhibitors in order to improve the efficiency of alkylating agent-based therapy. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"The DNA mismatch repair pathway (MMR) is involved in repair of base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops that occur during DNA replication. Over the years, many noncanonical roles have also been established for the MMR pathway, including response to increased oxidative DNA damage, a role in mitotic and meiotic recombination, in chromatin assembly and also in immunoglobulin diversification. Loss of function of mismatch repair genes gives rise to a mutator phenotype and is therefore unsurprisingly, a common feature of a range of different tumor types. In addition, due to a failure in recognition of many drug-induced adducts, MMR deficiency is frequently associated with resistance to many of the commonly used chemotherapies. The focus of this chapter is on mammalian DNA mismatch repair and the implications of its loss in cancer. In particular, we emphasize how exploiting the canonical and noncanonical role of the MMR pathway has elucidated novel ways of treating MMR-deficient cancers. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"In recent years major progress has been made in the understanding of cellular and molecular processes occurring after irradiation for both normal and tumor tissue. On the basis of this information new concepts were developed allowing a specific and efficient targeting of tumors by radiotherapy. In this context the combination of radiotherapy with specific inhibition of signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, or DNA repair are considered to have the greatest potential, because tumors are often deregulated in these processes. To implement these new concepts in the clinics, a broad understanding of the underlying mechanisms is also required allowing to determine reliable biomarkers needed to identify patients which will actually benefit from the new concept. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"DNA replication is arguably the most important biological process associated with cancer progression. This is evident as the inhibition of DNA synthesis remains one of the key therapeutic strategies used to treat this disease. This chapter describes the biological process of DNA replication focusing primarily on the roles of DNA polymerases in cancer progression and chemotherapy. The function of human DNA polymerases in replication, repair, recombination, and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) are discussed with a special emphasis on their biochemical, structural, and mechanistic features. The current arsenal of therapeutic agents used to inhibit DNA polymerase activity is described, paying particular attention to purine and pyrimidine nucleoside analogs. Preclinical and clinical applications of these nucleoside analogs are described with respect to mono- and combination therapy using DNA-damaging agents such as chlorambucil and cisplatin. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Homologous recombination (HR) is a molecular pathway involved in a multitude of processes, from the generation of genetic diversity to DNA repair and replication. HR provides a mechanism for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks, protecting cells from chromosomal aberrations such as those seen in cancer. During DNA replication, HR proteins promote the stability and recovery of troubled DNA replication forks. This adds robustness, helping the replication machinery avoid underreplication and subsequent chromosome segregation problems. In light of these important genome caretaker functions, it is perhaps not surprising that intrinsic HR deficiencies can promote genome instability and cancer. However, deficits in HR also sensitize tumors to standard-of-care DNA damage treatment and emerging DNA repair inhibitors directed against compensatory repair pathways. Here, we review the links that exist between HR and the development of cancer, and highlight proof-of-principle and clinical studies aimed at targeting HR for anticancer treatment. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"The NER (nucleotide excisions repair) pathway involves a coordinated series of interactions that enable the recognition and repair of bulky adduct DNA damage. Our understanding of the NER pathway has been significantly enhanced by the identification, characterization, and molecular analysis of cells and tissue obtained from individuals with Xeroderma pigmentosum. Reconstitution of the pathway in vitro has also enabled the molecular interactions to be interrogated in great detail. Finally, high-resolution structural analysis of many of the components provides a molecular basis for many of the interactions. Together, this convergence of knowledge provides a framework for efforts to disrupt the NER pathway to aid in the treatment of human disease, most notably cancer. It has been suggested all cancers display some defect in DNA repair and it has been demonstrated that the ability of cancer cells to repair therapeutically induced DNA damage impacts therapeutic efficacy. Although initial studies involving agents speculated to inhibit NER languished and were plagued by lack of specificity and a defined mechanism of action, more recent approaches to exploit synthetic lethal interactions and develop high-affinity chemical inhibitors have proven considerably more effective. In this chapter, we will highlight recent advances and discuss previous failures in targeting NER to pave the way for future DNA repair targeted agents and their use in cancer therapy. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are produced by metabolic, environmental, and chemotherapeutic agents that chemically link the double helix of DNA. Many lessons about how ICLs are repaired have been learned by study of the ICL-sensitive disorder, Fanconi anemia (FA). The FA pathway consists of at least 19 FANC gene products that coordinate detection, excision, recombination, and replication bypass of this most complex of DNA lesions. Different steps in ICL repair are prone to mutagenic errors that promote cancer or cell death. Here we review the molecular details of the FA pathway, and the links between ICL repair in both cancer initiation and treatment. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"With increased survival rates for cancer patients, toxicity secondary to anticancer therapies has become a prevalent clinical concern. Of major importance are toxicities occurring in postmitotic cells (cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and neurons) since these toxicities are quite debilitating, they often persist long after therapy is discontinued, and few interventions exist to prevent or reverse them. Although the mechanisms mediating these toxicities are not known, one promising area that requires further exploration is the ability of DNA repair mechanisms to reverse the toxic effects of a number of anticancer drugs. For example, studies in animal models show that enhancing the base excision repair pathway attenuates neuronal damage by chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that manipulating DNA repair mechanisms may be a novel approach to diminish neurotoxicity during or after cancer therapy. Whether DNA damage and repair are critical in cardiac and skeletal muscle toxicity after cancer therapy remains to be determined. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"This chapter will focus on the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is responsible for the repair of single-base lesions. BER is the predominant pathway for the repair of oxidative and alkylation DNA damage, as well as baseless sites. Data from several studies indicate that the coordination of the steps within this pathway is essential to genomic integrity and completion of repair. Without this balance of enzymatic activities, incomplete processing of the damage occurs, repair intermediates accumulate, and eventually cells die. Inhibition of proliferation and cell death are desirable in tumor therapy, therefore inhibitors of BER proteins are under development and are currently being evaluated in the clinic, particularly in combination with numerous existing chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy. Combination therapy with agents that generate DNA damage that is repaired through BER seems promising. Both preclinical and early clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of this hypothesis. Inhibitors of BER proteins (ie, APE1 and PARP1) have indications as single agents in tumor with a reduced capacity for DNA repair (BRCA1/2 mutations) and in combination regimens. BER inhibitors will likely increase the therapeutic index of currently used agents and will play a role in secondary treatments upon acquisition of resistance to traditional therapies.This chapter will give an overview of the BER pathway, with emphasis on the coordination of this complex DNA repair system with a glimpse on the current knowledge of the noncanonical roles of BER proteins. The current involvement of BER enzymes in tumorigenesis and therapy resistance, as well as the possibility to target BER enzymes for anticancer therapy, will be described at the end of this section. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Emerging evidence indicates that nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is comprised primarily of canonical NHEJ and alternative NHEJ (or noncanonical NHEJ) pathways. The former pathway results in minimal processing of the DSB ends, whereas the latter process typically results in insertions and deletions, with or without local sequence microhomology. Canonical NHEJ is considered the major pathway for the repair of DSBs induced by ionizing radiation in human cells. Noncanonical NHEJ was initially thought of as a ""backup"" pathway, since it first was discovered in cNHEJ-deficient cells. More recent studies, however, suggest that it may actively compete with both canonical NHEJ and homologous recombination (HR). In this chapter we review the current understanding of the basic mechanisms and regulation of the NHEJ subpathways, highlighting those insights with clinical implications. We also present potential opportunities in which NHEJ inhibition may be utilized for selective tumor cell targeting. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Sj├Âgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune systemic disease characterized by B-cell lymphoproliferation and an increased risk of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development, mainly of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, which impacts survival and mortality. MALT lymphoma arises from chronic inflamed tissues through a multistep process in which a local, chronic, antigenic stimulation, together with a predisposing genetic background and with additional proliferative stimuli provided by the local molecular and cellular milieu of ectopic lymphoid glandular tissue, allows the emergence of B-cell clonal expansion and its possible evolution into overt malignancy. A complete assessment of SS always includes salivary gland biopsy. Imaging may be helpful for a noninvasive assessment of lymphoproliferation but it cannot substitute biopsy. New therapeutic B-cell targeting strategies are emerging to treat SS-related lymphoproliferation, ie, SS itself. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Primary Sj├Âgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic, immune-mediated condition of unknown etiology characterized by focal lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands associated with dry mouth and eyes. There is a strong female bias. pSS typically affects women in the middle years with an estimated prevalence from studies in different countries of 0.04% to 0.6%. 75% of patients have anti-Ro and/or anti-La antibodies, often with raised immunoglobulin levels (hypergammaglobulinemia). There is a 44-times increased risk of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B-cell lymphoma in pSS, typically affecting the salivary glands. Anti-Ro/La antibodies are typically associated with the HLA-DR3-DQ2 haplotype. Genome-wide screening has identified interferon-related and B-cell-related genes linked to the development of pSS.There is less data in pSS from genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics, but these are active areas of research. Understanding the clinical relevance of these studies will be important if they are to translate into new therapeutic approaches. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"The formation of periductal lymphocytic infiltrates within the inflamed salivary glands represents the histological hallmark of primary Sj├Âgren's syndrome (pSS). Lymphomonocytic aggregates can spread within the tissue, affecting salivary gland morphology and function. On a discrete percentage of patients (?25%), it is possible to observe formation of organized germinal center (GC)-like structure, detection of which has been correlated to lymphoma development. Salivary gland histopathology is considered the gold standard for pSS diagnosis and is highly recommended in early phase clinical trials as a disease biomarker. This chapter reviews the histological features of normal and diseased salivary glands in the context of pSS and provides the reader with a tool to understand pSS histopathology and differential diagnosis, and to identify in the tissue key elements that characterize pSS pathogenesis. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Sj├Âgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune, inflammatory condition primarily involving the exocrine glands. Several environmental factors are involved in its pathogenesis, the main role being played by infectious agents. Nonetheless, stress, vaccines, low vitamin D levels, environmental pollution, silicone, and other factors may contribute as triggers in the existence of a predisposing genetic background.The pathogenic pathways leading to an immune response to such substances may cause, under specific circumstances, the disruption of tolerance and the development of autoimmune phenomena. Indeed, the loss of the immune system balance, with B-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and tissue infiltration, has been proposed. Unveiling these factors and pathways will be of great help in understanding and, at best, managing SS. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Hyperactivity of B cells is one of the main features of primary Sj├Âgren's syndrome (pSS). They have indeed been shown to produce autoantibodies, to synthesize cytokines, and to act as antigen-presenting cells. An increased ratio of mature B (Bm) 2 (CD38+IgD+) to Bm2' (CD38++IgD+) cells, along with a decreased number of early Bm5 (CD38+IgD- or CD38-IgD-) cells characterizes the disease. This reduction in the number of circulating memory B cells is associated with the settlement of memory B cells, transitional type 2, memory and marginal zone-like B cells in the salivary glands, suggesting that B cells play a leading part in the in situ autoantibody production. In addition, these patients show elevated serum levels of the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) of the tumor necrosis factor family, which rescues autoreactive B cells from apoptosis. Given that B cells are tightly involved in the pathogenesis of primary SS, novel prospects for treatment are opened, to such a degree that B-cell ablative therapy has already proven beneficial to the patients. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"The recent discovery of a variety of T-cell subpopulations challenged the long-standing paradigm of the T helper (Th) 1/Th2 immune response. The possible involvement of such novel cell subsets in autoimmunity fueled the investigation in this field. It is now becoming evident that Th17 cells as well as T regulatory and follicular T helper cells are leading actors in the scenario of primary Sj├Âgren's syndrome (SS) pathogenesis. Although sometimes conflicting, a consistent amount of data is available to date supporting that expanded T 17 cells are crucial in the induction and maintenance of chronic glandular inflammation and, eventually, ectopic lymphoid neogenesis. On the other hand, an impairment of counter-regulatory T lymphocytes may account for an imbalance between the effector and the suppressive arm of the autoimmune response. The better understanding of the abnormal T-cell response occurring in SS may provide the basis to target specific T-lymphocyte subpopulations for therapeutic purposes in this disease. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and range from dryness of the eyes and mouth (keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia) to more systemic manifestations such as fatigue. Autoantibodies against Ro/SSA and/or La/SSB are detectable in a majority of the patients. Approximately 90% of patients are females.
